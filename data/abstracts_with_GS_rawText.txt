"The effects of low doses of aspirin on the frequency and severity of painful vaso-occlusive crises were evaluated in children with sickle hemoglobinopathies. Aspirin was compared with placebo in 49 patients in a double-blind crossover study. Careful monitoring of patients revealed an average of 1.1 painful crises per patient year. During the 21 months of study, 70% of patients had a maximum of two painful crises, and 25% experienced four or more. The frequency and severity of crises were not affected by aspirin therapy. In view of aspirin's demonstrated effect on platelet function, we suggest that platelets do not contribute to the initiation or progression of the vaso-occlusive process.",

"The increase in fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in response to hydroxyurea (HU) varies among patients with sickle cell anemia. Twenty-nine candidate genes within loci previously reported to be linked to HbF level (6q22.3-q23.2, 8q11-q12 and Xp22.2-p22.3), involved in metabolism of HU and related to erythroid progenitor proliferation were studied in 137 sickle cell anemia patients treated with HU. Three-hundred and twenty tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for genotyping were selected based on HapMap data. Multiple linear regression and the nonlinear regression Random Forest method were used to investigate the association between SNPs and the change in HbF level after 2 years of treatment with HU. Both methods revealed that SNPs in genes within the 6q22.3-23.2 and 8q11-q12 linkage peaks, and also the ARG2, FLT1, HAO2 and NOS1 genes were associated with the HbF response to HU. Polymorphisms in genes regulating HbF expression, HU metabolism and erythroid progenitor proliferation might modulate the patient response to HU.",
"The median parasite clearance half-lives ranged from 1.9 hours in the Democratic Republic of Congo to 7.0 hours at the Thailand-Cambodia border. Slowly clearing infections (parasite clearance half-life >5 hours), strongly associated with single point mutations in the "propeller" region of the P. falciparum kelch protein gene on chromosome 13 (kelch13), were detected throughout mainland Southeast Asia from southern Vietnam to central Myanmar. The incidence of pretreatment and post-treatment gametocytemia was higher among patients with slow parasite clearance, suggesting greater potential for transmission. In western Cambodia, where artemisinin-based combination therapies are failing, the 6-day course of antimalarial therapy was associated with a cure rate of 97.7% (95% confidence interval, 90.9 to 99.4) at 42 days.",

"Triptans and analgetic nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs reduce acute pain syndromes in migraine. A further treatment option for an acute headache attack in patients with migraine may be the application of cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors, as they have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. The objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of an oral fast-dissolving tablet of 10 mg of rizatriptan, an intravenous infusion of 40 mg of parecoxib, and a subcutaneous pen injection of sumatriptan (6 mg/0.5 mL) on pain relief in 3 cohorts of patients with episodic migraine. They were treated owing to the acute onset of a pain attack as a case of emergency. They were randomized to treatment with sumatriptan, rizatriptan, or parecoxib. The participants completed a visual analog scale for pain intensity at baseline before the drug administration and then after intervals of 20, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. Rizatriptan, parecoxib, and sumatriptan reduced pain symptoms. Twenty and 30 minutes after drug intake, rizatriptan was more efficacious than parecoxib and sumatriptan, and parecoxib was more effective than sumatriptan. Only a significant difference between rizatriptan and sumatriptan was found after 60 and 120 minutes. This trial demonstrates the effectiveness of a parecoxib infusion in the treatment of acute migraine and that the circumvention of the first pass effect of the liver by rizatriptan may be beneficial for fast pain relief.",

"Over a period of 4 years, 118 of 223 children who received the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine and 138 of 224 of the controls had at least 1 episode of clinical malaria. Vaccine efficacies in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were 29.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.3 to 45.3; P=0.005) and 32.1% (95% CI, 11.6 to 47.8; P=0.004), respectively, calculated by Cox regression. Multiple episodes were common, with 551 and 618 malarial episodes in the RTS,S/AS01E and control groups, respectively; vaccine efficacies in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were 16.8% (95% CI, -8.6 to 36.3; P=0.18) and 24.3% (95% CI, 1.9 to 41.6; P=0.04), respectively, calculated by the Andersen-Gill extension of the Cox model. For every 100 vaccinated children, 65 cases of clinical malaria were averted. Vaccine efficacy declined over time (P=0.004) and with increasing exposure to malaria (P=0.001) in the per-protocol analysis. Vaccine efficacy was 43.6% (95% CI, 15.5 to 62.3) in the first year but was -0.4% (95% CI, -32.1 to 45.3) in the fourth year. Among children with a malaria-exposure index that was average or lower than average, the vaccine efficacy was 45.1% (95% CI, 11.3 to 66.0), but among children with a malaria-exposure index that was higher than average it was 15.9% (95% CI, -11.0 to 36.4).",

"The combination of fosmidomycin and clindamycin (F/C) is effective in adults and older children for the treatment of malaria and could be an important alternative to existing artemisinin-based combinations (ACTs) if proven to work in younger children. We conducted an open-label clinical trial to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of F/C for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Mozambican children <3 years of age. Aqueous solutions of the drugs were given for 3 days, and the children were followed up for 28 days. The primary outcome was the PCR-corrected adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28. Secondary outcomes included day 7 and 28 uncorrected cure rates and fever (FCT) and parasite (PCT) clearance times. Fifty-two children were recruited, but only 37 patients were evaluable for the primary outcome. Day 7 cure rates were high (94.6%; 35/37), but the day 28 PCR-corrected cure rate was 45.9% (17/37). The FCT was short (median, 12 h), but the PCT was longer (median, 72 h) than in previous studies. Tolerability was good, and most common adverse events were related to the recurrence of malaria. The poor efficacy observed for the F/C combination may be a consequence of the new formulations used, differential bioavailability in younger children, naturally occurring variations in parasite sensitivity to the drugs, or an insufficient enhancement of their effects by naturally acquired immunity in young children. Additional studies should be conducted to respond to the many uncertainties arising from this trial, which should not discourage further evaluation of this promising combination.",

"Pacemakers are frequently implanted, yet accurate prospective data on implant complications are limited. Elderly patients may be at increased risk of implant complications and are increasingly being referred for pacemaker implantation. The purpose of the present analysis was to define the incidence and possible predictors of serious complications of dual chamber permanent pacemaker implantation in the elderly. Therefore, we sought to prospectively identify the incidence and predictors of pacemaker implant complications in a large multicenter trial involving patients receiving a dual chamber pacemaker. The Pacemaker Selection in the Elderly (PASE) study was a prospective trial designed to evaluate quality of life in dual chamber pacemaker recipients age 65 years or older randomized to DDDR versus VVIR programming. In addition to being age 65 years or older, patients enrolled in this study were in normal sinus rhythm, and had standard indications for permanent pacemaker implantation. All patients received dual chamber pacemakers and were randomized to DDDR versus VVIR pacing. Pacemaker implant complications were collected on standardized forms which were completed at pacemaker implantation and during follow-up appointments. In this study of 407 patients, there were 26 complications occurring in 25 patients (6.1%). The most frequent complication was lead dislodgment which occurred in 9 patients. This was followed by pneumothorax (8 patients) and cardiac perforations (4 patients). In 18 patients (4.4%) repeat surgical procedures (including chest tubes) were required. Complications were noted prior to discharge in only 18 patients. There were no significant predictors of overall complications. Pneumothorax was more frequent in patients > or = 75 years old, and was observed only in patients with subclavian venous access. In conclusion, complications from pacemaker implantation in the elderly are seen in 6.1% of patients and 4.4% of patients require a repeat surgical procedure. Other than advanced age and lower weight predicting for pneumothorax, there are no significant clinical predictors of complications.",

"Sickle red blood cells (SSRBCs) adhere to both endothelial cells (ECs) and the extracellular matrix. Epinephrine elevates cyclic adenosine monophosphate in SSRBCs and increases adhesion of SSRBCs to ECs in a Î²-adrenergic receptor and protein kinase A-dependent manner. Studies in vitro as well as in vivo have suggested that adrenergic stimuli like epinephrine may contribute to vaso-occlusion associated with physiologic stress. We conducted both animal studies and a Phase I dose-escalation study in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients to investigate whether systemically administered propranolol inhibits SSRBC adhesion and to document the safety of propranolol in SCD. Systemically administered propranolol prevented SSRBC adhesion and associated vaso-occlusion in a mouse model. In patients receiving a single oral dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg propranolol, SSRBC adhesion to ECs was studied before and after propranolol, with and without stimulation with epinephrine. Propranolol administration significantly reduced epinephrine-stimulated SSRBC adhesion in a dose dependent manner (p = 0.03), with maximum inhibition achieved at 40 mg. Adverse events were not severe, did not show dose dependence, and were likely unrelated to drug. No significant heart rate changes occurred. These results imply that Î²-blockers may have a role as antiadhesive therapy for SCD.",
"Radioiodinated meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is used routinely for imaging and targeted radiotherapy of tumours derived from the neural crest. Since active uptake of MIBG by the noradrenaline transporter (NAT) makes a greater contribution to total drug accumulation than passive uptake when MIBG is present at low concentrations, tumour-specific uptake should be enhanced by the administration of lower molar amounts of MIBG. This could be achieved through the use of MIBG with a high specific activity. Commercially available preparations of 123I-MIBG have specific activities of approximately 200 MBq.mg-1. We have synthesized and used no-carrier-added (n.c.a.) 123I-MIBG produced by an iododesilylation reaction (specific activity 0.7 TBq.mg-1). We report here the first clinical studies comparing the commercially available and n.c.a. MIBG diagnostic preparations. Five patients with known phaeochromocytoma were studied. Unlike studies in animal models, no consistent improvement in tumour uptake was observed with the n.c.a. material. A larger patient group is required to determine whether there are significant differences between the two preparations, before proceeding to studies at therapeutic activity levels of n.c.a. 131I-MIBG. Even with no improvement in tumour uptake, n.c.a. MIBG may be the favoured formulation for therapeutic applications to reduce the molar amount of drug injected.",
"The objective of the present analysis was to determine the effects of a fixed combination of perindopril and indapamide in combination with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial was a factorial randomized controlled trial. A total of 11â140 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to fixed combination of perindopril-indapamide (4/1.25 mg) or placebo. Effects of randomized treatment on mortality and major cardiovascular outcomes were examined in subgroups defined by baseline use of CCBs. Patients on CCB at baseline (n=3427) constituted a higher risk group compared with those not on CCB (n=7713), with more extensive use of antihypertensive and other protective therapies. Active treatment reduced the relative risk of death by 28% (95% confidence interval, 10%-43%) among patients with CCB at baseline compared with 5% (-12% to 20%) among those without CCB (P homogeneity=0.02) and 14% (2%-25%) for the whole population. Similarly, the relative risk reduction for major cardiovascular events was 12% (-8% to 28%) versus 6% (-10% to 19%) for those with and without CCB at baseline although the difference was not statistically significant (P homogeneity=0.38). There was no detectable increase in adverse effects in those receiving CCB. The combination of perindopril and indapamide with CCBs seems to provide further protection against mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

"Edoxaban is an oral, reversible, direct factor Xa inhibitor in phase III clinical development for the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF). A phase II study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy of edoxaban in Asian patients with non-valvular AF with CHADS2 score â¥1. In a multicentre, active-controlled, double-blind edoxaban and open-label warfarin, parallel-group study, a total of 235 patients from four Asian countries were randomly assigned to edoxaban 30 mg qd, 60 mg qd or warfarin dose adjusted to international normalised ratio of 2-3 for three months. The primary endpoint was the incidence of centrally adjudicated all bleeding events (major, clinically relevant non-major and minor). Secondary endpoints included thromboembolic events, biomarkers of thrombus formation and all adverse events (AEs). The incidence of all bleeding events (95% CI) was 20.3% (12.9, 30.4) for edoxaban 30 mg, 23.8% (15.8, 34.1) for edoxaban 60 mg, and 29.3% (20.2, 40.4) for warfarin. A subgroup analysis suggested low body weight (â¤60 kg) may affect the incidence of bleeding events with edoxaban. The incidence of study drug-related AEs was 22% for edoxaban 30 mg, 29% for edoxaban 60 mg and 33% for warfarin. No thromboembolic events occurred in any treatment group. In conclusion, this phase II study found a trend for a reduction in the incidence of all bleeding events in Asian AF patients with edoxaban 30 mg and 60 mg compared with warfarin. Adverse events were similar between the edoxaban 60-mg and warfarin groups and were lower with the edoxaban 30-mg group.",
"This multi-center study compared the therapeutic effect of a cognitive-behavioral minimal contact program (MCT) to the effect of a brochure (bibliotherapy) for the prevention of medication overuse headache (MOH) in migraine patients. Seven German headache centers recruited 182 migraine patients with high triptan or analgesic intake frequency. Patients were randomly allocated to either the MCT-group, receiving both an MCT program and an educational brochure or to the biblio-group receiving only the brochure. All participants continued usual medical treatment. Course of headaches, intake of analgesics or triptans after training, 3 months post-training as well as 1-2 years (mean 15.7 months) later and psychological variables were defined as outcome variables. A significant decline was observed in the number of headache days (11.0-8.8), migraine days (7.3-5.7) and medication intake days (7.4-6.1) from pre to post in the MCT-group (p<0.001 each) and in the biblio-group (p<0.001 each). The pre-to-post-improvements were maintained from pre- to short- and from pre- to long-term follow-up (p<0.001 each) in both groups. Both groups improved significantly from pre to post in psychological variables, e.g. pain acceptance: p<0.001; pain catastrophizing: p<0.001; functional pain coping: p<0.001; and pain related internal control beliefs: p<0.01. Psychological improvements remained stable in both groups at short- and long-term follow-up. During the study, none of the patients developed an MOH. MCT- and bibliotherapy are useful in migraine patients to prevent medication overuse headache or the transition of episodic to chronic headache.",

"Acute headache medication overuse (MO) is common in patients with chronic migraine (CM). We evaluated safety and efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA as preventive treatment of headache in CM patients with baseline MO (CM+MO) in a planned secondary analysis from two similarly designed, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel, Phase III trials. Patients were randomized to treatment groups (155-195 U of onabotulinumtoxinA or placebo) using MO (patient-reported and diary-captured frequency of intake) as a stratifying variable. Of 1384 patients, 65.3% (n=904) met MO criteria (onabotulinumtoxinA: n=445, placebo: n=459). For the CM+MO subgroup at Week 24, statistically significant between-treatment group mean changes from baseline favoring onabotulinumtoxinA versus placebo were observed for headache days (primary endpoint: -8.2 vs. -6.2; p<0.001) and other secondary endpoints: frequencies of migraine days (p<0.001), moderate/severe headache days (p<0.001), cumulative headache hours on headache days (p<0.001), headache episodes (p=0.028), and migraine episodes (p=0.018) and the percentage of patients with severe Headache Impact Test-6 category (p<0.001). At Week 24, change from baseline in frequency of acute headache medication intakes (secondary endpoint) was not statistically significant (p=0.210) between groups, except for triptan intakes (p<0.001), where the onabotulinumtoxinA-treated group was favored.

"Iron overload is present in several cases of double heterozygous sickle-cell/beta-thalassemia (HbS/Î²-thal). Deferasirox is an orally administered iron chelator which is effective on iron overloaded patients with transfusion-dependent anemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of deferasirox on HbS/Î²-thal patients with iron overload. We evaluated 31 adult patients with HbS/Î²-thal (14M/17F; median age 41 years) who had serum ferritin levels >1,000 ng/mL and who were sporadically transfused. Total iron burden was monitored by measuring serum ferritin levels before and monthly after starting deferasirox, while liver iron concentration and cardiac iron burden were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 and T2* parameters at baseline and 12 months after deferasirox treatment. Deferasirox managed to reduce the mean serum ferritin levels after 12 months of treatment from 1,989 Â± 923 to 1,008 Â± 776 ng/mL (P < 0.001). This reduction was accompanied by a significant improvement on MRI T2* of the liver (from 3.9 Â± 3.2 to 5.8 Â± 3.1 ms; P < 0.01) and by a comparable improvement of biochemical parameters of liver function. Mild nausea and diarrhea of grade 1/2 were reported in 25% of patients within the first month of treatment, but did not re-occur. These data indicate that deferasirox provided effective control of iron levels (mainly of the liver) in minimally transfused patients with HbS/Î²-thal, without significant adverse events, at similar doses to those studied widely for the treatment of patients with thalassemia syndromes.",

HIV-TB coinfected patients are then referred to Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART) center for initiation of ART between two weeks and two months of initiating TB treatment. During the third phase of National AIDS Control Programme (NACP-III, April 2007-April 2012), 30749/130503 (23.6%) TB/HIV cross-referrals were lost to follow up (LTFU) and there was missed opportunity for 940/1884 (49.9%) HIV-TB coinfected patients for initiation of ART during TB treatment. This motivated Delhi State AIDS Control Society (DSACS) and State TB Cell (STC) to revise existing cross-referral strategy. The new strategy was launched in May 2012, wherein HIV-TB coinfected and HIV-positive "TB-suspects" were referred to nearest ART center for HIV care and investigations of TB at Chest Clinic/Designated Microscopy Centre (DMC) located within the same hospital instead of referral to area RNTCP facility. Outcome of the strategy was evaluated in March 2013.

"This intervention study conducted in the Neurology outpatient Department of Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH) from January 2006 to December 2007 to compare efficacy of amitriptyline, pizotifen and propranolol in the prophylaxis of migraine. Ninety cases were selected following certain inclusion and exclusion criteria. Result showed that the differences in duration, frequency and severity of attack were reduced in all groups but the differences among the groups were not significant (p>0.05). However, compared with amitriptyline and pizotifen, the propranolol group needed tablet paracetamol as abortive therapy less frequently which was statistically significant (p<0.05). All the drugs were well tolerated with minimum adverse effects.",

"Overall, CRT improved LV but not RV structure and function with little evidence of an interaction with TAPSE. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 748 (582 to 950) days, 213 deaths occurred. Patients with lower TAPSE had a higher mortality, regardless of assigned treatment (p < 0.001). Greater inter-ventricular mechanical delay, New York Heart Association functional class, mitral regurgitation, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, lower TAPSE, and assignment to the control group were independently associated with higher mortality. Reduction in mortality with CRT was similar in each tertile of TAPSE.",
"Although reduced natural killer (NK) cell levels have been reported consistently in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the clinical significance and persistence of this immune perturbation is not clarified. In this study we characterized the NK cell deficit further by determining (i) differentiation surface markers and cytokine profile of NK cell subsets and (ii) ability to reconstitute NK cell levels over time. Flow cytometry was used to analyse NK cell subsets and the intracellular cytokine profile in 31 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI), 34 patients with stable angina (SA) and 37 healthy controls. In blood collected prior to coronary angiography, the proportions of NK cells were reduced significantly in non-STEMI and SA patients compared with controls, whereas NK cell subset analyses or cytokine profile measurements did not reveal any differences across groups. During a 12-month follow-up, the proportions of NK cells increased, although not in all patients. Failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with several components of metabolic syndrome. Moreover, interleukin (IL)-6 levels remained high in patients with sustained NK cell deficit, whereas a decline in IL-6 (P < 0Â·001) was seen in patients with a pronounced increase in NK cells. In conclusion, we found no evidence that reduction of NK cells in CAD patients was associated with aberrations in NK cell phenotype at any clinical stage of the disease. Conversely, failure to reconstitute NK cell levels was associated with a persistent low-grade inflammation, suggesting a protective role of NK cells in CAD.",

"A pilot study of electrochemical treatment (ECT) as a therapy for 386 patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer was undertaken. There were 103 stage II cases, 89 stage IIIa cases, 122 stage IIIb cases, and 72 stage IV cases. Two ECT methods were used: For peripherally located lung cancer, platinum electrodes were inserted transcutaneously into the tumor under x-ray or CT guidance. For central type lung cancer or for those inoperable during thoracotomy, electrodes were inserted intraoperatively directly into the cancer. Voltage was 6-8 V, current was 40-100 mA, and electric charge was 100 coulombs per cm of tumor diameter. The number of electrodes was determined from the size of cancer mass, because the diameter of effective area around each electrode is approximately 3 cm. The short-term (6 months after ECT) results of the 386 lung cancer cases were: complete response (CR), 25.6% (99/386); partial response (PR), 46.4% (179/386); no change (NC), 15.3% (59/386); and progressive disease (PD), 12.7% (49/386). The total effective rate (CR + PR) was 72% (278/386). The 1, 3, and 5 year overall survival rates were 86.3% (333/386), 58.8% (227/386), and 29.5% (114/386), respectively. The main complication was traumatic pneumothorax, with an incidence rate of 14.8% (57/386). These clinical results show that ECT is simple, safe, effective, and minimally traumatic. ECT provides an alternative method for treating lung cancers that are conventionally inoperable, that are not responsive to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or that cannot be resected after thoracotomy. Long-term survival rates suggest that ECT warrants further investigation.",

"Development of hospital-acquired anemia (HAA) during acute myocardial infarction may be related to processes of care and is associated with poor outcomes. Little is known about variation in the incidence of HAA across hospitals or the hospital characteristics associated with HAA. We studied 17,676 patients with acute myocardial infarction without anemia at admission, defining HAA as a hemoglobin decline below anemia diagnostic thresholds and moderate-to-severe HAA as a hemoglobin decline to <11Â g/dl. We calculated median rate ratios (MRRs), the median value of the relative risk (RR) for HAA for 2 patients with identical characteristics presenting to 2 randomly selected hospitals, to identify variation in HAA adjusting for patient characteristics. Separate models were fit to test the association between hospital characteristics and HAA. HAA (57.5%) and moderate-to-severe HAA (20.1%) were common. The incidence of HAA varied substantially across hospitals and remained significant after multivariable adjustment (any HAA: MRR 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.13; moderate-to-severe HAA: MRR 1.27, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.39). Adjusting for patient characteristics, teaching status (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.97 vs nonteaching status), and region (Northeast vs Midwest: RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.19; West vs Midwest: RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.33, respectively) was associated with risk of HAA. Teaching status (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6 to 0.9 vs nonteaching status) and region (South vs Midwest: RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.5) were independently associated with moderate-to-severe HAA. In conclusion, we observed significant variability in the incidence of HAA across hospitals and found a lower risk of HAA at teaching centers, suggesting that qualitative studies of the relation between HAA and processes of care are needed to identify targets for quality improvement.",
"Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are the first-line treatment of uncomplicated malaria. The public health benefit and safety of repeated administration of a given ACT are poorly studied. We conducted a randomized trial comparing artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS+AQ) and artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) in patients 6 months of age and older with uncomplicated malaria in Mali from July 2005 to July 2007. The patient received the same initial treatment of each subsequent uncomplicated malaria episode except for treatment failures where quinine was used. Overall, 780 patients were included. Patients in the AS+AQ and AS+SP arms had significantly less risk of having malaria episodes; risk ratio (RR) = 0.84 (P = 0.002) and RR = 0.80 (P = 0.001), respectively. The treatment efficacy was similar and above 95% in all arms. Although all drugs were highly efficacious and well tolerated, AS+AQ and AS+SP were associated with less episodes of malaria.",

"To investigate the temporal association between frequency of non-nocturnal hypoglycemia and sleep quality among patients with diabetes receiving insulin therapy.We used data from 1â513 patients with diabetes receiving insulin therapy. We estimated the relative risks (RR) of the frequency of non-nocturnal hypoglycemia for poor sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.The average age and HbA1c value of the patients were 63.7 years and 7.8%, respectively. Compared with poor sleep quality in patients without any type of non-nocturnal disabling hypoglycemia (NNDH), the multivariable-adjusted RR values for poor sleep quality were 1.30 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.61) and 1.37 (95% CI, 0.96-1.95) in patients who experienced 1-4 and â¥5 episodes of NNDH, respectively (p=0.004). Experiencing non-nocturnal severe hypoglycemia (NNSH) once in the past 90 days significantly increased the risk of poor sleep quality by 1.54 episodes (95% CI, 1.16-2.05; p=0.003). By adding the presence of depression as a variable to the multivariable-adjusted model, these associations were attenuated because we did not observe any significant association between NNDH and poor sleep quality (p=0.178). However, a significant association between NNSH and poor sleep quality was observed (RR=1.43; 95% CI, 1.09-1.90; p=0.011).A high frequency of non-nocturnal hypoglycemia was associated with poor sleep quality in patients with diabetes receiving insulin therapy. Our data also suggested that the association of NNDH, and not NNSH, was mediated by comorbid depression.",

"Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is the key pathogenic factor of gram-positive bacteria and contributes significantly to organ dysfunction in sepsis, a frequent complication in critical care patients. We hypothesized that LTA directly affects cardiomyocyte function, thus contributing to cardiac failure in sepsis. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of LTA on contractile properties and calcium-transients of isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes. When myocytes were exposed to LTA for 1h prior to analysis, the amplitudes of calcium-transients as well as sarcomere shortening increased to 130% and 142% at 1 Hz stimulation frequency. Relengthening of sarcomeres as well as decay of calcium-transients was accelerated after LTA incubation. Exposure to LTA for 24 h resulted in significant depression of calcium-transients as well as of sarcomere shortening compared to controls. One of the major findings of our experiments is that LTA most likely affects calcium-handling of the cardiomyocytes. The effect is exacerbated by reduced extracellular calcium, which resembles the clinical situation in septic patients. Functionally, an early stimulating effect of LTA with increased contractility of the cardiomyocytes may be an in vitro reflection of early hyperdynamic phases in clinical sepsis. Septic disorders have been shown to induce late hypodynamic states of the contractile myocardium, which is also supported at the single-cell level in vitro by results of our 24h-exposure to LTA.",
"High levels of the novel inflammatory marker YKL-40 have been demonstrated in inflammatory environments and in remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Both are key components in atrial wall remodeling in atrial fibrillation (AF). We studied the relation between rhythm outcome after electrical cardioversion (ECV) for persistent AF and serum levels of YKL-40. A secondary point of interest was a potential effect of the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan on YKL-40 levels. In the Candesartan in the Prevention of Relapsing Atrial Fibrillation (CAPRAF) study, 171 patients with persistent AF were randomized to receive candesartan 8mg once daily or placebo for 3-6 weeks before ECV and candesartan 16mg once daily or placebo for 6 months after ECV. Serum levels of YKL-40 were measured in fasting blood samples collected at baseline and at end of the study. Mean age was 64Â±11 years, and 39 (22.8%) were women. Sinus rhythm was maintained for 6 months after ECV in 41 (23.9%). Baseline levels of YKL-40 were significantly correlated to age (Spearmans rho; rs=0.442; p<0.001), CHA2DS2-VASc(1) score (rs=0.256; p<0.001) and left atrial diameter (rs=0.185; p=0.017). By use of Kaplan-Meier quartile analysis of baseline YKL-40 levels, no relation between YKL-40 levels and risk of AF recurrence was found. End of study YKL-40 levels were unchanged from baseline, both in patients with AF recurrence and those maintaining sinus rhythm for 6 months. Treatment with candesartan had no influence on serum YKL-40 levels.",

"We evaluated the effects of myocardial perfusion after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on gender-based mortality rates. Research has demonstrated a gender-specific response of cardiomyocytes to ischemia and a potential increase in myocardial salvage in women compared with men. Myocardial blush grade (MBG), an angiographic surrogate of myocardial perfusion, is an independent predictor of early and late survival after AMI. Whether the incidence and prognosis of myocardial perfusion differs according to gender among patients with AMI undergoing PCI is unknown. MBG and short- and long-term mortality were evaluated in 1,301 patients (maleÂ = 935; femaleÂ = 366) with AMI randomized to primary angioplasty Â± abciximab versus stent Â± abciximab. Following PCI, >96% of patients achieved final Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 3 flow, of which MBG 2/3 was present in 58.3% of women versus 51.1% of men (pÂ = 0.02). Worse MBG was an independent predictor of mortality in women at 30 days (7.4% for MBG 0/1 vs 2.4% for MBG 2/3, pÂ = 0.04) and at 1-year (11.0% for MBG 0/1 vs 3.4% for MBG 2/3, pÂ = 0.01); however, MBG was not associated with differences in mortality for men. In conclusion, impaired myocardial perfusion following PCI for AMI, indicated by worse MBG, is an independent predictor of early and late mortality in women but not in men. These findings imply an enhanced survival benefit from restoring myocardial perfusion for women compared with men during primary angioplasty and may have clinical implications for interventional strategies in women.",

In a controlled trial in 1981 the method was found to be as good as earlier stated, but the method has a high number of side effects and has never been widely accepted. In a prospective, controlled trial comparing silver nitrate pleurodesis with tetracycline pleurodesis, we found no differences in recurrence frequency, but the time of hospitalization was significantly longer in the silver nitrate group (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, we found a decrease of exudation and a decreased use of analgetics in the tetracycline group. As a consequence of the investigation, we have abandoned the silver nitrate method and now recommend tetracycline pleurodesis as the treatment of choice in primary spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with only tiny blebs on the surface of the lung.",

"Hydroxyurea therapy reduces hemolysis and decreases serum bilirubin levels in children and adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA) and may therefore help prevent the development of cholelithiasis in this patient population. We recently reported that a promoter polymorphism in the uridine diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) gene affects steady-state bilirubin levels and the incidence of gallstones in children with SCA. We have now analyzed the influence of the UGT1A genotype on the therapeutic response to hydroxyurea. A large cohort of children with SCA taking hydroxyurea therapy at the maximum tolerated dose demonstrated significant reductions in hemolysis independent of UGT1A promoter polymorphism genotype, but the hydroxyurea-related decreases in serum bilirubin levels were significantly different. Children with the wild-type 6/6 UGT1A genotype demonstrated normalized bilirubin levels with hydroxyurea therapy, but children with the heterozygous 6/7 or abnormal 7/7 genotypes did not. Children with the abnormal 7/7 genotype, which confers the phenotype of Gilbert syndrome, had bilirubin levels greater than 3 mg/dL despite full-dose hydroxyurea therapy. These data indicate the UGT1A promoter polymorphism is a powerful nonglobin genetic modifier in SCA that influences serum bilirubin both at baseline and on hydroxyurea therapy. UGT1A promoter polymorphisms may therefore influence the ability of hydroxyurea to prevent gallstone formation in patients with SCA.",

The primary endpoint was in-stent late lumen loss (LLL) at nine-month follow-up. The secondary endpoint, target lesion failure (TLF), was defined as the composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (TVMI), or ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation (iTLR). Patients were centrally randomised to treatment with either biodegradable polymer SES (n=227) or durable polymer EES (n=231).

"Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) has been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in observational studies. Also, SNPs to explain variation in 25(OH)D have been identified by genome-wide association studies. Detection of direct associations between SNPs that significantly affect 25(OH)D and CVD risk would indicate a causal role of vitamin D, as reverse causation could be excluded and confounding could be better controlled. Thus, a combined analysis of candidate SNPs in relation to circulating 25(OH)D and CVD risk was carried out. A case-cohort study within the EPIC-Germany study was conducted comprising a randomly drawn subcohort of 2,132 subjects (57.9% women, mean age: 50.6 years) and incident cases of myocardial infarction (n=559) and stroke (n=471) that occurred during a mean follow-up duration of 7.6 years. 25(OH)D concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS in baseline plasma samples. Additionally, eight candidate SNPs were assayed. Associations between 25(OH)D, SNPs and the risks of myocardial infarction and stroke were assessed by multivariable regression analyses. Mean 25(OH)D level was 47.2 nmol/L in the subcohort. Four SNPs were associated with 25(OH)D (p<0.05). In subjects with 25(OH)D levels <25 nmol/L, the risks of CVD as composite endpoint (Hazard Ratio: 1.53, 95% confidence interval: 1.12-2.09), myocardial infarction, and stroke were significantly increased compared to subjects with levels â¥ 50 nmol/L, while no significant linear associations were observed. A SNP score was not related to the risks of total CVD (Hazard Ratio: 1.0, 95% confidence interval: 0.71-1.42), myocardial infarction, or stroke. The same was true concerning single SNPs. Given the lack of association between SNPs and the risks of stroke and myocardial infarction, the present findings do not point to a major causal role of vitamin D in the development of these diseases. However, a detection of modest associations between genetic markers and CVD risk in larger consortia cannot be ruled out.",
"Artesunate (AS) in combination with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) is the first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Sudan. The objective of this study was to assess the potential impact of SP on the pharmacokinetics of AS and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), in healthy adults. A single-dose, randomized, open-label, crossover study design with a washout period of three weeks was performed with 16 volunteers. After oral administration of AS alone or in combination with SP, Tmax values of AS and DHA were significantly prolonged in the combination group (P < 0.05). However, there was no significant effect on the other pharmacokinetic parameters (P > 0.05). The t1/2 values of AS and DHA were significantly higher in females than in males (P < 0.05). The present findings suggest that co-administration of SP with AS has no clinically relevant impact on the pharmacokinetics of AS or DHA in healthy persons.",

"The increasing use of EIT in clinical research on severely ill lung patients requires a clarification of the influence of pathologic impedance distributions on the validity of the resulting tomograms. Significant accumulation of low-conducting air (e.g. pneumothorax or emphysema) or well-conducting liquid (e.g. haematothorax or atelectases) may conflict with treating the imaging problem as purely linear. First, we investigated the influence of stepwise inflation and deflation by up to 300 ml of air and 300 ml of Ringer solution into the pleural space of five pigs on the resulting tomograms during ventilation at constant tidal volume. Series of EIT images representing relative impedance changes were generated on the basis of a modified Sheffield back projection algorithm and ventilation distribution was displayed as functional (f-EIT) tomograms. In addition, a modified simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) was applied to quantify the resistivity distribution on an absolute level scaled in Omega m (a-EIT). Second, we applied these two EIT techniques on four intensive care patients with inhomogeneous air and fluid distribution and compared the EIT results to computed tomography (CT) and to a reference set of intrathoracic resistivity data of 20 healthy volunteers calculated by SIRT. The results of the animal model show that f-EIT based on back projection is not disturbed by the artificial pneumo- or haematothorax. Application of SIRT allows reliable discrimination and detection of the location and amplitude of pneumo- or haematothorax. These results were supported by the good agreement between the electrical impedance tomograms and CT scans on patients and by the significant differences of regional resistivity data between patients and healthy volunteers.",

We obtained the following results: (1) plasma cyclic AMP increases in response to upright posture in control subjects and hypertensive patients; (2) values of cyclic AMP in the recumbent and upright positions are comparable in control subjects and patients with essential hypertension, but are significantly higher in those with true renovascular hypertension due to bilateral renal artery stenosis; (3) propranolol inhibits the increase of plasma cyclic AMP in response to posture in control subjects, but has an opposite effect in labile hypertension where there is a further increase; (4) the rise in blood pressure in pheochromocytoma is associated with a considerable increase in plasma cyclic AMP.Present and previous data suggest that kidney handling of cyclic AMP is abnormal in hypertension, and that the specific defect may be related to the type of hypertension.",
"Hydroxyurea improves hematologic parameters for children with sickle cell disease (SCD), but its long-term efficacy at maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has not been determined. Between 1995 and 2002, hydroxyurea therapy was initiated for 122 pediatric patients with SCD including 106 with homozygous sickle cell anemia (HbSS), 7 with sickle hemoglobin C (HbSC), 7 with sickle/beta-thalassemia (HbS/ beta-thalassemia [6 HbS/beta0, 1 HbS/beta+]), and 2 with sickle hemoglobin OArab (HbS/OArab). Median age at initiation of therapy was 11.1 years. Hydroxyurea was escalated to MTD, with an average dose of 25.4 +/- 5.4 mg/kg per day; the average duration of hydroxyurea therapy has been 45 +/- 24 months (range, 6-101 months). Hydroxyurea was discontinued for 15 (12%) children with poor compliance. Mild transient neutropenia occurred, but no hepatic or renal toxicity was noted. Hydroxyurea therapy led to significant increases in hemoglobin level, mean corpuscular volume, and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) level, whereas significant decreases occurred in reticulocyte, white blood cell, and platelet counts and serum bilirubin levels. Children with variant SCD genotypes also had hematologic responses to hydroxyurea. HbF induction has been sustained for up to 8 years without adverse effects on growth or increased numbers of acquired DNA mutations. Long-term hydroxyurea therapy at MTD is well tolerated by pediatric patients with SCD and has sustained hematologic efficacy with apparent long-term safety.",

"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is a serious yet common complication after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Risk factors for postoperative AF have been identified, including echocardiographic parameters, and these are relied on to implement preventative strategies that reduce the incidence of AF. There has yet to be a study examining the impact of echocardiographic right-sided cardiac parameters on the prediction of postoperative AF. Thus, a panel of right-sided cardiac parameters was measured in a cohort of patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery, excluding those who did not have echocardiographic assessment within 30 days before surgery and those with any history of AF. The primary outcome was postoperative AF defined as any episode of AF requiring treatment during the index hospitalization. Postoperative AF occurred in 197 of 768 patients (25.6%); these were older and more likely to have hypertension and chronic kidney disease. After adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic variables, left atrial volume index â¥34 ml/m(2) (odds ratio [OR] 1.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36 to 2.87), abnormal right ventricular myocardial performance index (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.24), and advancing age (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.07) were found to be independent predictors of postoperative AF. In conclusion, right ventricular myocardial performance index is a novel predictor of postoperative AF in patients undergoing isolated CABG surgery and appears to be additive to established risk factors such as age and left atrial volume.",

"The aim of the present observational study was to assess the value of the C825T polymorphism of the beta-3 subunit of G proteins (GNB3) as well as of variants in the SLC6A4 gene (5HTTLPR and STin2 VNTR) and DRD2 gene (TaqI A and NcoI) as predictive markers for consistency in headache response to triptans in migraine patients. Consistent responders to triptans were defined as the migraineurs who experienced a > or =2 point reduction in a 4-point scale intensity of pain from 3 (severe) to 0 (absent) 2h after triptan administration, in at least two attacks out of the three. Genotyping was performed by PCR and PCR-RFLP on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood. The impact of clinical and biological variables on consistency status of headache response to triptans was evaluated by using a binary logistic regression model with stepwise selection. Forty-three (33%) of the 130 migraine patients included in the study did not consistently respond to triptan administration. In a binary logistic regression model, STin 2.12/12 genotype (OR=3.363, 95% CI: 1.262-8.966, P=0.005) and non-use of migraine prophylactic medications (OR=2.848, 95% CI: 1.019-7.959, P=0.010) were found as significant factors increasing the odds of achieving inconsistent response to triptans. The analysis of classificatory power of the model showed moderate values of sensitivity (0.56), high specificity (0.87), and an overall prediction correctness (0.77). These results support the role of STin2 VNTR polymorphism of serotonin transporter gene as a relevant genetic factor conferring a higher risk of inconsistent response to triptans in migraine patients.",

"Neuropsychologic data are presented from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study with placebo, topiramate 50 mg/day, and topiramate 100 mg/day. The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and cognitive adverse events were used to evaluate neurocognitive effects of topiramate. Topiramate 100 mg/day vs placebo was associated with slight statistically significant score increases, indicating slowing, from baseline vs placebo in three CANTAB measures: five-choice reaction time (P = 0.028), pattern recognition memory mean correct latency (P = 0.027), and rapid visual information processing mean latency (P = 0.040). No other patterns related to topiramate treatment were observed in measurements of learning, memory, and visual information processing, except for potential improvement with topiramate 100 mg/day vs placebo in spatial span total errors (accuracy test) (P = 0.040). The most common cognitive and neuropsychiatric adverse events with a higher incidence in the topiramate 50 and 100 mg/day groups vs placebo were anorexia (9% and 11% vs 3%), insomnia (9% and 3% vs 3%), fatigue (6% and 9% vs 6%), and dizziness (6% and 9% vs 0%). Thus, topiramate 100 mg/day was associated with modest increases in psychomotor reaction times. Learning, memory, and executive function were unchanged. The tolerability profile, including cognitive adverse events, appeared to be acceptable.",

"The primary objective of this study was to compare the safety of four fixed-dose regimens of edoxaban with warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). In this 12-week, parallel-group, multicentre, multinational study, 1,146 patients with AF and risk of stroke were randomised to edoxaban 30 mg qd, 30 mg bid, 60 mg qd, or 60 mg bid or warfarin dose-adjusted to a target international normalised ratio of 2.0-3.0. The study was double-blind to edoxaban dose, but open-label to warfarin. Primary outcomes were occurrence of major and/or clinically relevant non-major bleeding and elevated hepatic enzymes and/or bilirubin. Mean age was 65 +/- 8.7 years and 64.4% were warfarin-naÃ¯ve. Whereas major plus clinically relevant non-major bleeding occurred in 3.2% of patients randomised to warfarin, the incidence of bleeding was significantly higher with the edoxaban 60 mg bid (10.6%; p=0.002) and 30 mg bid regimens (7.8%; p=0.029), but not with the edoxaban 60 mg qd (3.8%) or 30 mg qd regimens (3.0%). For the same total daily dose of 60 mg, both bleeding frequency and trough edoxaban concentrations were higher in the 30-mg bid group than in the 60-mg qd group. There were no significant differences in hepatic enzyme elevations or bilirubin values among the groups. The safety profiles of edoxaban 30 and 60 mg qd in patients with AF were similar to warfarin. In contrast, the edoxaban bid regimens were associated with more bleeding than warfarin. These results suggest that in this three-month study, edoxaban 30 or 60 mg qd are safe and well-tolerated.",
"We investigated the effectiveness of thin-section computed tomography (CT) for the diagnosis of bullous lesions in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. The study group consisted of 74 patients. Apical regions of the lung were scanned for lesions by thin-section CT prior to operation. The presence, number, and locations of bullous lesions were assessed. Bullous lesions were also classified into 2 groups according to their shape as demonstrated by CT findings. Operative findings confirmed that 73 of the 74 patients had bullous lesions. Of these, 33 had a single bulla and 40 had multiple bulla. Thin-section CT accurately detected the presence and location of the bullous lesions, accurately identified the number in all but 6 patients with multiple bulla (accuracy: 91.8%), and also classified them accurately by type. Precise evaluations of bullous lesions are crucial to the treatment of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. The presence of bullous lesions, as well as their location and shape, are important factors in determining whether to operate or not. Such information also allows for a better understanding of the surgical options available. Our study demonstrated that thin-section CT of apical regions of the lung is an effective diagnostic procedure for patients with spontaneous pneumothorax.",

"Gender differences exist in outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft surgery but have yet to be fully explored after transcatheter aortic valve implantation. We aimed to investigate gender differences after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in the UK National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research registry. A retrospective analysis was performed of Medtronic CoreValve and Edwards SAPIEN implantation in 1,627 patients (756 women) from January 2007 to December 2010. Men had more risk factors: poor left ventricular systolic function (11.9% vs 5.5%, p <0.001), 3-vessel disease (19.4% vs 9.2%, p <0.001), previous myocardial infarction (29.5% vs 13.0%, p <0.001), peripheral vascular disease (32.4% vs 23.3%, p <0.001), and higher logistic EuroSCORE (21.8 Â± 14.2% vs 21.0 Â± 13.4%, p = 0.046). Thirty-day mortality was 6.3% (confidence interval 4.3% to 7.9%) in women and 7.4% (5.6% to 9.2%) in men and at 1 year, 21.9% (18.7% to 25.1%) and 22.4% (19.4% to 25.4%), respectively. There was no mortality difference: p = 0.331 by log-rank test; hazard ratio for women 0.91 (0.75 to 1.10). Procedural success (96.6% in women vs 96.4% in men, p = 0.889) and 30-day cerebrovascular event rates (3.8% vs 3.7%, p = 0.962) did not differ. Women had more major vascular complications (7.5% vs 4.2%, p = 0.004) and less moderate or severe postprocedural aortic regurgitation (7.5% vs 12.5%, p = 0.001). In conclusion, despite a higher risk profile in men, there was no gender-related mortality difference; however, women had more major vascular complications and less postprocedural moderate or severe aortic regurgitation.",

"Prospective, placebo-controlled, single-blind, randomized clinical investigation of the influence of domestic 3-hydroxypyridine and succinic acid derivatives (emoxipin, reamberin, mexidol) on the effectiveness of a complex treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) has been performed in a group of patients. It is established that intravenous infusion of 3-hydroxypyridine derivatives (emoxipin and mexidol) for two weeks, beginning 14 days after the start of POAG treatment, produced a retinoprotective action, with three months postponed changes in the central retinal artery (CRA) blood velocity. The retinoprotective effect of emoxipin (single dose, 150 mg) was manifested by reduction in the horizontal size of blind spot in two weeks, with the subsequent reduction of the CRA end-diastolic blood velocity observed three months after finish of the infusion therapy. The administration of mexidol (single dose, 300 mg) after 14 days of treatment led to widening of the summarized field of vision (test-object square, 16 mm), accompanied by a decrease in the electrosensitivity threshold of the optic nerve and the intensity of POAG-associated hypothymia. All indices of CRA blood velocity increased three months after termination of mexidol infusions. Reamberin (single dose, 400 ml 1,5% solution of reamberine, containing polyelectrolyte and meglumine succinate mixture) did not show retinoprotective action, but caused proatherogenic changes of blood lipids and 3 months postponed CRA end-diastolic blood velocity increase. The effect of mexidol (which is a derivative of both 3- hydroxypyridine and succinic acid) exceeds that of separate 3-hydroxypyridine (emoxipin) and succinic acid (reamberin) derivatives in the degree of retinoprotection and positive effect on the optic nerve condition and mood of POAG patients.",

"We studied major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptide-presentation and nature of the antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell response from South African tuberculosis (TB) patients with active TB. 361 MHC class I binding epitopes were identified from three immunogenic TB proteins (ESAT-6 [Rv3875], Ag85B [Rv1886c], and TB10.4 [Rv0288], including amino acid variations for Rv0288, i.e., A10T, G13D, S27N, and A71S for MHC allotypes common in a South African population (e.g., human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-A*30, B*58, and C*07). Inter-allelic differences were identified regarding the broadness of the peptide-binding capacity. Mapping of frequencies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells using 48 different multimers, including the newly constructed recombinant MHC class I alleles HLA-B*58:01 and C*0701, revealed a low frequency of CD8+ T-cell responses directed against a broad panel of co-dominant M. tb epitopes in the peripheral circulation of most patients. The antigen-specific responses were dominated by CD8+ T-cells with a precursor-like phenotype (CD45RA+CCR7+). The data show that the CD8+ T-cell response from patients with pulmonary TB (prior to treatment) is directed against subdominant epitopes derived from secreted and non-secreted M. tb antigens and that variant, natural occurring M. tb Rv0288 ligands, have a profound impact on T-cell recognition.",
"Outcomes in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA) who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have been limited to small, mostly single-center studies. We compared patients who underwent PCI after CA included in the CathPCI Registry with those without CA. Patients with ST elevation were classified as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); all other patients having PCI were classified as without STEMI. Patients with CA in each group were compared with the corresponding non-CA groups for baseline characteristics, angiographic findings, and outcomes. A total of 594,734 patients underwent PCI, of whom 114,768 had STEMI, including 9,375 (8.2%) had CA, and 479,966 had without STEMI, including 2,775 (0.6%) had CA. Patients with CA were similar in age to patients with non-CA, with a lower frequency of coronary disease risk factors and known coronary disease. On angiography, patients with CA were significantly more likely to have more complex lesions with worse baseline thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow. Patients with CA were significantly more likely to have cardiogenic shock, both for patients with STEMI (51% vs 7.2%, respectively) and for patients without STEMI (38% vs 0.8%, respectively, both p<0.001). In-hospital mortality was substantially worse in patients with CA, for both patients with STEMI (24.9% vs 3.1%, respectively) and patients without STEMI (18.7% vs 0.4%, respectively). In conclusion, patients who underwent PCI after CA had more complex anatomy, more shock, and higher mortality. The substantially increased mortality in patients with CA has important implications for the development and regionalization of centers for CA.",

"A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, superiority clinical trial was designed to assess clinical efficacy of antazoline in rapid conversion of AF to sinus rhythm. Eligible patients will present AF lasting less than 43 hours, will be in stable cardio-pulmonary condition and will have no prior history of advanced heart failure or significant valvular disease. Long-term antiarrhythmic therapy is not considered an exclusion criterion. Subjects who fulfill selection criteria will be randomly assigned to receive intravenously either antazoline or placebo in divided doses and observed for 1.5 hours after conversion to sinus rhythm or after the last i.v. bolus. Primary end point will be the conversion of AF to sinus rhythm confirmed in an electrocardiogram (ECG) during the observation period. Secondary end points will be comprised of time to conversion and return of AF during the observation period. Special consideration will be given to the observation of any adverse events. A sample size of 80 patients was calculated based on the following assumptions: two-tailed test, a type I error of 0.01, a power of 90%, efficacy of placebo 5%, efficacy of antazoline 50% and 20% drop-out rate to fulfill the criteria of intention-to-treat analysis. Due to the presumed lack of statistical power, the secondary end points and safety endpoints will be considered exploratory.",

"Four patients with well-documented severe recurrent painful sickle cell crises received 12-month courses of self-administered minidose heparin (5000-7500 units every 12 hours). Patients were evaluated weekly or bi-weekly for symptoms and signs of sickle crises. The observations were compared with identical observations during 12 months off heparin (control). Prior to starting heparin, baseline laboratory values were established, including hematocrits, platelet counts, and plasma coagulation factors. Bone density was evaluated by radiologic measurement of metacarpal cortical width and by forearm transmission osteodensitometry. Laboratory values were repeated at each visit; bone density was reevaluated every 6 months. At each visit clinical status for the preceding 1-2 weeks was classified as: no pain (I), minor pain controllable by non-prescription medications (II), pain requiring office or emergency room admissions for parenteral narcotics (III), hospitalized for about 3 days for pain crisis (IV). One patient completed a single 2-year cycle; one patient completed 2 cycles (followed 4 years), and 2 patients have undertaken 3 cycles (followed greater than or equal to 6 years). No treatment-related complications occurred requiring discontinuation of heparin. Thrombocytopenia was not observed. There was no evidence of progressive osteopenia. All patients improved while receiving heparin; 1 moderately, 3 markedly. Cumulative data (8.7 patient years on heparin, 12 control years) revealed a 73% reduction in days of hospitalization per year and 74% reduction in hours spent in emergency rooms per year during heparin administration. Pretreatment pain patterns recurred when heparin was discontinued.",

"The disappointing efficacy of blood-stage malaria vaccines may be explained in part by allele-specific immune responses that are directed against polymorphic epitopes on blood-stage antigens. FMP2.1/AS02(A), a blood-stage candidate vaccine based on apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) from the 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum, had allele-specific efficacy against clinical malaria in a phase II trial in Malian children. We assessed the cross-protective efficacy of the malaria vaccine and inferred which polymorphic amino acid positions in AMA1 were the targets of protective allele-specific immune responses. FMP2.1/AS02(A) had the highest efficacy against AMA1 alleles that were identical to the 3D7 vaccine-type allele at 8 highly polymorphic amino acid positions in the cluster 1 loop (c1L) but differed from 3D7 elsewhere in the molecule. Comparison of the incidence of vaccine-type alleles before and after vaccination in the malaria vaccine and control groups and examination of the patterns of allele change at polymorphic positions in consecutive malaria episodes suggest that the highly polymorphic amino acid position 197 in c1L was the most critical determinant of allele-specific efficacy. These results indicate that a multivalent AMA1 vaccine with broad efficacy could include only a limited set of key alleles of this extremely polymorphic antigen.",
"We retrospectively examined SpO2 during one-lung anesthesia (OLA). One hundred and fifty patients of ASA 1 or 2 for thoracoscopic surgery were anesthetized with propofol and fentanyl (n = 93) or pentazocine (n = 57) and mechanically ventilated with FIO2 = 0.6 in the lateral decubitus position. Twelve patients (8%) developed SpO2 < or = 95% in the first 20 minutes of OLA. It has been reported that hypoxemia during OLA occurs in 13-40% of patients under inhalation anesthesia with FIO2 = 1.0. Our results show the total intravenous anesthesia using propofol is useful to maintain SpO2 during OLA. SpO2 during OLA tended to fall in the patients for right side operation, with lower SpO2 during two-lung ventilation and higher body mass index (BMI). However BMI has never been reported as a predictor of hypoxemia during OLA. A gravity-dependent mechanism is considered to be more responsible for the dependent regional volume reduction during OLA in patients in the lateral decubitus position.",

"Cold therapy has long been the number one self-care treatment employed for migraine without aura and the second most common for migraine with aura, yet its mechanism remains elusive. In this study, a mechanism by which this time-tested therapy works is proposed (by cooling the blood passing through intracranial vessels) in an attempt to further elucidate its beneficial effects. The study is designed as a randomized, controlled, crossover clinical trial utilizing an adjustable wrap containing two freezable ice packs targeting the carotid arteries at the neck, where they come close to the skin surface. Fifty-five participants successfully completed the study. Pain at onset, as recorded on a visual analog scale, was similar between the two treatment arms. Maximum pain reduction was observed at the 30 minute time point with a 31.8% Â± 15.2% decrease in pain in the treatment arm compared to a 31.5% Â± 20.0% increase in pain at the same time interval in the control arm.

"Moderate intravenous (IV) sedation combined with local anesthesia is common for outpatient oral surgery procedures. An ideal sedative agent must be safe and well tolerated by patients and practitioners. This study evaluated fospropofol, a relatively new sedative/hypnotic, in comparison to midazolam, a commonly used benzodiazepine, for IV moderate sedation during oral and maxillofacial surgery. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to either the fospropofol or the midazolam group. Each participant received 1 Î¼g/kg of fentanyl prior to administration of the selected sedative. Those in the fospropofol group received an initial dose of 6.5 mg/kg, with 1.6 mg/kg supplemental doses as needed. Those in the midazolam group received initial doses of 0.05 mg/kg, followed by 0.02 mg/kg supplemental doses. The quality of sedation in each patient was evaluated with regard to (a) onset of sedation, maintenance, and recovery profile; (b) patient and surgeon satisfaction; and (c) hemodynamic stability and adverse effects. The fospropofol group demonstrated shorter physical recovery times than midazolam patients, taking a mean of 11.6 minutes versus 18.4 minutes for physical recovery (P = .007). Cognitive recovery comparison did not find any difference with a mean of 7.5 minutes versus 8.8 minutes between the 2 drug groups (P = .123). The fospropofol group had a higher rate of local anesthetic injection recall (90.5 vs 44.4%, P = .004). Other parameters of recall were comparable. Two adverse effects demonstrated significance, with more patients in the midazolam group experiencing tachycardia (48.2 vs 9.4%, P = .001), and more patients in the fospropofol group experiencing perineal discomfort (40.6 vs 0, P < .001). No significant difference was found in any other measures of sedation safety, maintenance, or satisfaction. Fospropofol, when administered intravenously by a dentist anesthesiologist at the indicated dose in this study, appears to be a safe, well-tolerated alternative to midazolam for intravenous moderate sedation during minor oral surgery procedures.",

The procedures included blebectomy with pleurodesis 14 cases; wedge resection 10 cases; malignant pleural effusion, pleural biopsy and pleurodesis 4 cases; pleural biopsy 3 cases; lung tumor biopsy 2 cases; lung biopsy 2 cases. Converted into thoracotomy 2 cases because of the tumors could not be resected thoracoscopically. No death and severe complication. The procedures were successful for diagnosis and treatment in our series. Compared with standard thoracotomy, the operative trauma, postoperative pain, drainage volume, tube time, postoperative hospitalization were remarkably less in this group (P < 0.05).",

"Non-tuberculous mycobacterial isolates from gold miners were speciated using standard biochemical testing (SBT) and 16S rDNA sequencing. Of 237 isolates tested, SBT identified 126, compared with all 237 identified using sequencing. Of 111 isolates unspeciated by SBT but identified by sequencing, 38 (34.2%) were identified as Mycobacterium gordonae and 8 (7.2%) were new species. Of 126 isolates speciated by both methods, 37 were discordant, with 14/17 M. gordonae isolates incorrectly identified as M. scrofulaceum using SBT. The majority of these were the potentially pathogenic strain D, M. gordonae. Sequencing is preferable where available to guide treatment.",

"Retrospective studies suggest that statins might exert an antiarrhythmic effect on the heart. The mechanism of this effect is unclear. Parasympathetic stimulation of the heart has been shown to protect against ventricular arrhythmias. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of statins on ventricular arrhythmias and its correlation with changes in parasympathetic responsiveness and Galpha(i2) expression. Patients were randomized to pravastatin and simvastatin in a double-blind crossover design. Ventricular arrhythmias were determined by analysis of 24-hour Holter recordings. Spectral RR interval analysis of Holter studies determined peak high-frequency power fraction, which reflects parasympathetic modulation of heart rate. Expression of Galpha(i2), a molecular component of the parasympathetic response pathway, was determined by Western blots of patients' lymphocytes. Pravastatin treatment decreased the incidence of ventricular premature complexes by 22.5 + or - 3.4% (n = 20, p <0.05), couplets, and runs of 3 to 6 beats of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia from 9.8 + or - 2.67 to 3.9 + or - 1.25 events/patient/24 hours (n = 12, p <0.05). Pravastatin increased peak high-frequency fraction by 29.8 + or - 4.3% (n = 33, p <0.001), while Galpha(i2) expression increased by 51.3 + or - 22.5% (n = 21, p <0.05). Effects of simvastatin on ventricular premature complexes and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia were not significant. Relative changes in couplets and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in pravastatin-treated patients correlated negatively with changes in Galpha(i2) and high-frequency fraction (rho = -0.588 and rho = -0.763, respectively, n = 12, p <0.05). In conclusion, these data suggest that pravastatin might decrease cardiac irritability via an increase in parasympathetic responsiveness and that changes in Galpha(i2) expression might serve as a molecular marker for this effect, which might play a role in the molecular mechanism of the antiarrhythmic effect of statins.",
"The aim of this prospective, non-randomized interventional study was to assess electrophysiological effects, efficacy and safety of intravenous propafenone in termination of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT). This single-center study was carried out at Department of Cardiology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital in Zagreb, Croatia, between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006. Eligibility requirements were fulfilled by a total of 70 patients with AVNRT (n=37) and AVRT (n=33). The intervention consisted of the electrophysiological study aimed at inducing tachycardia, followed by intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg propafenone in both groups. The main outcome measures were safety and efficacy of 2 mg/kg intravenous propafenone in tachycardia termination and re-induction. Out of 37 patients with AVNRT, propafenone managed to terminate it in 28 (75.7%) patients, while tachycardia was not inducible in 25 (67.56%) patients. Out of 33 patients with AVRT, propafenone managed to terminate AVRT in 29 (87.9%) patients, while tachycardia was not inducible in 22 (66.66%) patients. The overall propafenone efficacy in tachycardia termination was 81.42%. No propafenone-related adverse effects were recorded during the study period. Propafenone was found to be a safe and effective anti-arrhythmic drug and can be justifiably administered for AVNRT and AVRT termination. It could be considered as an alternative to adenosine and verapamil.",
"Pain perception studies in migraine patients have shown trigeminal and peripheral pain facilitation during the migraine attack. We were interested in differences of trigeminal and peripheral pain perception between migraine patients during the migraine interval and healthy subjects. Perception of electrical pain stimulation was measured in 20 migraine subjects outside a migraine attack (10 migraine with aura and 10 migraine without aura) and in 20 healthy subjects. We recorded sensory and pain thresholds, pain ratings after suprathreshold stimulation, and pain rating after two trains of repetitive stimulation (i.e., pain facilitation). Migraine subjects showed a significantly higher pain rating after suprathreshold stimulation in the trigeminal region as compared to healthy subjects (4.8 +/- 1.6 versus 3.8 +/- 2.2, p < 0.04 after Bonferroni correction) but not in the peripheral region. Furthermore, migraine subjects showed a pain facilitation after repetitive trigeminal stimulation whereas healthy subjects showed a pain habituation. We observed no significant differences between migraine subjects and healthy subjects for all parameters in the peripheral stimulation. Migraine patients with and without aura did not differ in any parameter. All subjects showed decreased sensory and pain thresholds after trigeminal as compared to peripheral stimulation. Migraine subjects show an increased pain perception after trigeminal but not after peripheral pain stimulation as compared to healthy subjects. This phenomenon is probably due to the observed pain facilitation after painful trigeminal stimulation.",
"A randomized trial of surfactant replacement therapy at birth was conducted at the University of Rochester between June 1983 and November 1985. Thirty-four premature infants, 25 to 29 weeks' gestational age, received a preventilatory dose of a calf lung surfactant extract in saline prepared at the University of Rochester. A control group of 31 infants received a preventilatory dose of saline alone. The major finding of this trial is that a single preventilatory dose of calf lung surfactant extract reduces the severity of the respiratory distress syndrome during the first 24 hours of life. The beneficial effects, however, are not sustained in many infants and diminish after 24 hours of life. The survival rate was 71% in both the control and surfactant-treated groups. There was a lower incidence of pneumothorax in the surfactant-treated group. There were no differences in the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, and intraventricular hemorrhage. No adverse effects of surfactant replacement therapy were identified. Results of this study suggest that multiple postventilatory doses of surfactant will be required for optimal therapy.",
"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is common after cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital stay. Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) has been applied recently for evaluation of LA function. The purpose of this study was to examine whether left atrial longitudinal strain measured by STE is a predictor for the development of POAF following mitral valve surgery for severe mitral regurgitation. We studied 53 patients undergoing mitral valve surgery in sinus rhythm at the time of surgery. Echocardiography with evaluation of LA strain by STE was performed. Detection of POAF was based on documentation of AF episodes by continuous telemetry throughout hospitalization. Patients who did not develop POAF were taken as group 1 and those who had POAF constituted group 2. The echocardiographic and clinical predictors of POAF were investigated. POAF occurred in 28.3% of subjects. Mean age, LAVi and BNP were found higher in group 2 while peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) (13.9 Â± 3.8% vs. 24.8 Â± 7.3%; P < 0.001), peak atrial contraction strain (PACS) (7.6 Â± 1.95% vs. 11.3 Â± 3.5%; P < 0.001) were significantly lower. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, PALS and LAVi were independent predictor of POAF development. LA longitudinal strain was found to predict POAF in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. It could be used to better identify patients at greater risk of developing POAF, and thus to guide in risk stratification and to take appropriate intensive prophylactic therapy.",
"During the H1N1 influenza pandemic (pH1N1/09) diagnostic algorithms were developed to guide antiviral provision. However febrile illnesses are notoriously difficult to distinguish clinically. Recent evidence highlights the importance of incorporating travel history into diagnostic algorithms to prevent the catastrophic misdiagnosis of life-threatening infections such as malaria. We applied retrospectively the UK pH1N1/09 case definition to a unique cohort of healthy adult volunteers exposed to Plasmodium falciparum malaria or influenza to assess the predictive value of this case definition, and to explore the distinguishing clinical features of early phase infection with these pathogens under experimental conditions. For influenza exposure the positive predictive value of the pH1N1/09 case definition was only 0.38 (95% CI: 0.06-0.60), with a negative predictive value of 0.27 (95% CI: 0.02-0.51). Interestingly, 8/11 symptomatic malaria-infected adults would have been inappropriately classified with influenza by the pH1N1/09 case definition, while 5/8 symptomatic influenza-exposed volunteers would have been classified without influenza (PÂ =Â 0.18 Fisher's exact). Cough (PÂ =Â 0.005) and nasal symptoms (PÂ =Â 0.001) were the only clinical features that distinguished influenza-exposed from malaria-exposed volunteers. An open mind regarding the clinical cause of undifferentiated febrile illness, particularly in the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms, remains important even during influenza pandemic settings. These data support incorporating travel history into pandemic algorithms.",
"Spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation in newborn infants may damage the lung. To find out whether the prevalence of lesions which might be due to trauma was reduced by muscle relaxation, fifty infants who required mechanical ventilation of hyaline membrane disease were randomly assigned to treated and control groups. The treated infants were kept muscle relaxed with pancuronium bromide until they needed a FiO2 of 0.40 or less during ventilation. The mean birthweight, gestational age, age at entry to the trial, duration of intubation and ventilation, FiO2 during the acute phase of the illness, and ventilator pressures were closely comparable in the two groups. Two of twenty-six treated infants and one of twenty-four controls died. Four treated and five control infants acquired pneumothoraces and/or interstitial emphysema. The length of time that the treated infants required added oxygen was significantly less than in the control infants. All treated infants were breathing room air spontaneously by one month of age whereas seven control infants were still dependent on added oxygen, needing an average FiO2 of 0.35 to achieve a mean PaO2 of 6.5 kPa (49 mm Hg). These seven infants required added oxygen until they were 5-18 (mean 10) weeks old. Muscle relaxation during mechanical ventilation for hyaline membrane disease speeds recovery of the lungs, probably owing to a reduction in traumatic damage.",

"This pharmacogenetic substudy of the prospective, double-blind, randomized CIBIS-ELD trial determined the impact of the Î²1-adrenoceptor Arg189Gly polymorphism on heart-rate responses to bisoprolol or carvedilol in elderly patients with heart failure (421 with sinus rhythm, 107 with atrial fibrillation). Patients were randomized 1:1 to bisoprolol or carvedilol with a fortnightly dose-doubling scheme and guideline target doses. Patients with sinus rhythm responded essentially identically to bisoprolol and carvedilol, independent of genotype. Atrial fibrillation patients homozygous for Arg389 had a much smaller response to carvedilol than carriers of at least one Gly389 allele (mean difference 12 bpm, P < 0.00001). Carvedilol up to 2 Ã 12.5 mg did not reduce heart rate in Arg389Arg homozygotes at all. Interestingly, the immediate response to carvedilol did not differ between genotypes. The Arg389Gly polymorphism has a major impact on the heart-rate response to carvedilol (but not bisoprolol) in patients with heart failure plus atrial fibrillation.",
"Primary headaches (migraines and tension-types headaches) are very common in school-aged children. Ginkgolide B, a herbal constituent extract from Ginkgo biloba tree leaves, was considered as a promising pharmacological aid for the treatment of migraine in adult patients because of its modulation of the glutamatergic transmission in the CNS and on antiplatelet activating factor (PAF). The aim of study is to verify the effectiveness and safety of association of Ginkgolide B/Coenzyme Q10/Riboflavin/Magnesium complex for brief prophylaxis in a population of school-aged children with migraine. In our sample after 3 months of treatment with association of Ginkgolide B/Coenzyme Q10/Riboflavin/Magnesium complex, the mean frequency per month of migraine was significantly decreased (9.71 Â± 4.33 vs. 4.53 Â± 3.96 attacks; p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that in childhood headache management, the use of alternative treatments must be considered not to evoke a placebo effect, but as soft therapy without adverse reactions.",
"Plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were measured before and after glucagon administration in 28 patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma: three patients were subsequently found to have tumors. The norepinephrine response predicted the presence or absence of a tumor in 27 of the 28 patients. Epinephrine levels doubled, on the average, in patients who did not have pheochromocytomas, and were not useful in distinguishing the patients with or without tumors. A comparison of the response to glucagon and a placebo indicated that changes in plasma catecholamine levels were hormone-related and not the result of side-effects accompanying injection. The glucagon provocation test, with measurement of plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels, may be a useful adjunctive tool for evaluating patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma when performed according to a standardized protocol and interpreted in relation to appropriate controls.",
"The purpose of this study was to determine the age-related risks, disease-specific risks, and characteristics of serious pneumococcal infections in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) while penicillin prophylaxis was standard. The clinical experiences of three pediatric sickle cell programs spanning January 1, 1992, to May 31, 1998, were combined. Data were collected regarding the patients followed up and the characteristics of bacteremia and meningitis cases. Forty-seven pneumococcal infections (44 bacteremia, 3 meningitis) among 40 patients with SCD were observed. Forty infections occurred in children with homozygous hemoglobin S (SS) during 4108 patient-years at a median age of 22 months; 7 occurred in double heterozygous hemoglobin SC (SC) children during 1777 patient-years at a median age of 23 months. Ten infections occurred among 9 SS children 5 years or older. Most children in whom infections developed were reportedly taking prophylactic penicillin and when older than 24 months old had received Pneumovax (Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, PA, U.S.A. The following pneumococcal serotypes were identified in 15 cases studied: 6A, 6B, 9V, 14, 15B, 18B, 18F, 19F, and 23F. Infections resulted in five deaths and two strokes. The observed severe pneumococcal infection rate in SS children younger than 5 years was less than that reported before penicillin prophylaxis, supporting routine penicillin prophylaxis in this specific population. The optimal duration of penicillin prophylaxis in older children with SCD remains unknown. The administration of 7-valent Prevnar (Wyeth Lederle Vaccines, Philadelphia, PA, U.S.A.) to children younger than 24 months old with SCD should be beneficial, based on the serotype data.",

"International guidelines do not specify what testing should be performed during emergency department (ED) evaluations for patients presenting with an exacerbation of previously diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that low CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores predict normal routine diagnostic testing in these patients. We conducted an analysis within a prospective observational cohort study at a university-affiliated hospital. We included patients with previously diagnosed AF and who presented to the ED primarily for an AF-related complaint. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores and abnormal results for blood counts, electrolytes, cardiac markers, thyroid function, and chest x-rays. We included 216 patients in this analysis. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for each point increase in CHADS2 for abnormal blood counts, electrolytes, troponin I, brain natriuretic peptide, thyroid function, and chest x-ray were 1.28 (0.99 to 1.65), 1.48 (1.19 to 1.84), 1.42 (1.10 to 1.82), 1.66 (1.15 to 2.41), 0.95 (0.70 to 1.29), and 1.17 (0.94 to 1.44), respectively. The corresponding odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for each point increase in CHA2DS2-VASc were 1.17 (0.96 to 1.42), 1.27 (1.09 to 1.49), 1.30 (1.07 to 1.57), 1.57 (1.18 to 2.10), 0.98 (0.79 to 1.22), and 1.14 (0.97 to 1.33), respectively. Among ED patients with established AF who underwent evaluation for acutely symptomatic AF, nearly 3/4 of routine diagnostic tests return to normal. In conclusion, patients with CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 have the lowest likelihood of abnormal studies and may represent an easily identifiable group of patients who need fewer ED tests.",

"Empirical use of fluoroquinolones (FQ) to treat a variety of bacterial infections may inadvertently select for FQ-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis(MTB), especially in rural China where the use of FQ in treating infections has not been standardized. Here we determine the prevalence and describe the transmission of FQ-resistant MTB in two rural counties in eastern China through a combination of conventional epidemiology with IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism(RFLP) analysis and DNA sequencing of drug-resistance determining regions. Phenotypic FQ resistance was detected in 31 of 351(8.8%) isolates. FQ resistance was equally distributed between patient-isolates deemed drug resistant and drug-susceptible, but mostly observed in those with treatment history of respiratory infection. Mutations in gyrA were found in 54.8% of FQ resistant isolates, and one isolate with a gyrB mutation. Despite predominating in entire bacilli population(69.2%), Beijing family strain had similar proportion of FQ resistance to the other(10.3% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.060). IS6110RFLP identified 2 clusters(4 isolates) among FQ resistant isolates and 3 clusters composed of both 4 FQ resistant isolates and 6 FQ susceptible isolates. Our results indicate that FQ-resistant MTB has emerged among the circulating bacillary population in rural eastern China. The relatively low level of clustering among FQ-resistant strains suggests most are acquired de novo, likely due to widespread FQ use.",
"The use of adjunctive medications to control intraocular pressure was significantly higher for latanoprost patients compared to travoprost and bimatoprost patients. This finding should be interpreted in the context that this study was based only on prescription claims data. It is important to simplify ophthalmic medical regimen as it is more cost effective, better for the patient, and minimizes the washout effect from administering two eye medications within 5 min. Decreasing the complexity of the patients' drug regimen may lead to increased adherence to prescribed therapy and a decreased risk of the incidence of blindness.",

"Compared with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), long-term outcomes are known to be worse in patients with unstable angina/non-STEMI (UA/NSTEMI), which might be related to the worse health status of patients with UA/STEMI. In patients with UA/NSTEMI and STEMI underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), angina-specific and general health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) was investigated at baseline and at 30 days after PCI. Patients with UA/NSTEMI were older and had higher frequencies in female, diabetes and hypertension. After PCI, both angina-specific and general HRQOL scores were improved, but improvement was much more frequent in angina-related HRQOL of patients with UA/NSTEMI than those with STEMI (44.2% vs 36.8%, P < 0.001). Improvement was less common in general HRQOL. At 30-days after PCI, angina-specific HRQOL of the patients with UA/NSTEMI was comparable to those with STEMI (56.1 Â± 18.6 vs 56.6 Â± 18.7, P = 0.521), but general HRQOL was significantly lower (0.86 Â± 0.21 vs 0.89 Â± 0.17, P = 0.001) after adjusting baseline characteristics (P < 0.001). In conclusion, the general health status of those with UA/NSTEMI was not good even after optimal PCI. In addition to angina-specific therapy, comprehensive supportive care would be needed to improve the general health status of acute coronary syndrome survivors.",

"Twenty-three patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax and 30 patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax treated by intercostal catheter drainage with underwater seal were divided randomly into two groups, one receiving suction drainage (up to 20 cm H2O pressure) and the other no suction. The success rate was 57% for the former and 50% for the latter. The suction group spent an average of five days in hospital, whereas the non-suction group averaged four days. Suction drainage therefore did not have any advantage. To determine how soon the catheter could be removed without complication, patients were also divided randomly into two subgroups--one had the catheter removed, without previous clamping, as soon as the lung was expanded; the other had the catheters left in situ for a further three days. The success rate was 52% for the former, and 53% for the latter. But most of the failure in the early removal group was caused by re-collapse of the lung rather than persistent air leakage; hence removal of the catheter too early was not recommended.",

"In the phase I/II pediatric hydroxyurea safety trial (HUG-KIDS), school-aged children with sickle cell anemia receiving hydroxyurea at the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) had variable increases in the percentage of fetal hemoglobin (%HbF). To identify predictors of the HbF response to hydroxyurea therapy, baseline clinical and laboratory values (age, sex, hemoglobin concentration, %HbF, reticulocytes, white blood cell [WBC], platelets, and serum chemistries), as well as treatment variables (number of toxicities, noncompliance, MTD dose, and MTD blood counts) were analyzed in 53 HUG-KIDS children who achieved MTD. Baseline %HbF values (P =.001), baseline hemoglobin concentration (P =.01), MTD dose (P =.02), and compliance (P =.02) were significantly associated with a higher %HbF at MTD; in contrast, age, sex, number of toxicities, and other baseline hematologic parameters were not. After adjusting for variations in baseline %HbF, the baseline reticulocyte count (P =.05) and baseline WBC count (P =.05) were also significantly associated with a higher %HbF at MTD. Hydroxyurea-induced increases in the hemoglobin concentration and mean corpuscular volume (both higher absolute values at MTD and larger positive changes from baseline values), as well as hydroxyurea-induced decreases in reticulocytes and WBC count, were significantly associated with a higher %HbF at MTD. These data suggest that selected baseline laboratory parameters, a higher MTD dose with attention to compliance, and greater therapy-related changes in blood counts may predict the HbF response to hydroxyurea therapy for children with sickle cell anemia. The HbF response to hydroxyurea is variable and complex, however, and even children with low baseline %HbF values can develop substantial increases in %HbF at MTD.",

"Despite consistent evidence of a protective effect of Î±(+)-thalassemia against severe Plasmodium falciparum disease, the mechanisms underlying this protection remain unknown. An increase in risk of Plasmodium vivax malaria in early childhood resulting in a cross-species protection against severe P. falciparum malaria has been proposed as a possible mechanism in Melanesian children. The association of Î±(+)-thalassemia genotypes with a risk of P. falciparum and P. vivax infection and uncomplicated illness was reassessed in a cohort of 1,112 Papua New Guinean children, followed from 3 to 21 months of age. Three hundred and eighty-nine (35.0%) children were homozygous for Î±(+)-thalassemia (-Î±/-Î±), 506 (45.5%) heterozygous (Î±Î±/-Î±) and 217 (19.5%) homozygous for the wild-type allele. No significant differences in the incidence of P. falciparum (Pf) or P. vivax (Pv) malaria were observed between Î±(+)-thalassemia homozygote (Pf: incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.13, CI(95) (0.82, 1.56), P=0.45, Pv: IRR=1.15, CI(95) (0.88, 1.50), P=0.31), heterozygote (Pf: IRR=0.98, CI(95) (0.71, 1.34), P=0.93, Pv: IRR=1.14, CI(95) (0.88, 1.48), P=0.33) and wild-type children. The prevalence of infection with either species did not differ between Î±(+)-thalassemia genotypes, although densities of P. vivax (but not of P. falciparum) infections were significantly higher in Î±(+)-thalassemia homozygote and heterozygote children. An excessive risk of moderate-to-severe anemia (Hb<8 g/dl) was observed in Î±(+)-thalassemia homozygote children (IRR=1.54, CI(95) (1.12, 2.11), P=0.008). This study therefore failed to confirm an increased risk of P. vivax or P. falciparum malaria in very young, Î±(+)-thalassemic children without significant levels of acquired immunity. This confirms the lack of protection by Î±(+)-thalassemia against uncomplicated P. falciparum and challenges the hypothesis of immunological cross-protection between P. falciparum and P. vivax as a mechanism underlying Î±(+)-thalassemia protection against severe P. falciparum disease in Melanesian children.",

"Sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients are at high risk of developing malaria which is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in this disease. In Senegal, malaria transmission is high during rainy season, between July and October, and it was noted that sickle-cell crisis are frequent during this period. Then we carried out a double-blind randomized controlled trial to compare the impact of monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) during the high-transmission season versus placebo on malaria incidence and morbidity of sickle-cell anemia. Sixty (60) SCD patients were randomized either to receive three intermittent preventive treatment (ITP) with SP or placebo using the random permutation table with nine elements. The drug was administrated as follows: sulfadoxine 25 mg/kg and pyrimethamine 1.25 mg/kg and this treatment was given once during the following months: September, October, and November. Overall four episodes of malaria disease were diagnosed, all these cases in the placebo arm. Thus, overall prevalence was 6.6% and there was no other case of malaria in the SP arm during the study period. Parasitological diagnosis confirmed the presence of Plasmodium falciparum in all four cases. No patient death was encountered during the study. SP treatment was well tolerated as only one patient (1.6%) in the SP arm reported pruritus. A significant reduction of patients' complaints (p = 002) and blood requirements (p = 0.001) was noted in the SP group; whereas, no impact was observed on vaso-occlusive crisis and hospitalization occurrence. Malaria prophylaxis by monthly intake of SP during the transmission period of the parasite reduced the prevalence of malaria and was safe in SCD patients leaving in malaria endemic area.",

"The purpose of this study was to determine the association between hydroxyurea treatment and changes in employment status, if any, among patients with sickle cell anemia enrolled in the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH). To that end, we compared the employment status among treatment responders, treatment nonresponders, and placebo groups of patients enrolled in MSH during the clinical trial and follow-up periods. Treatment with hydroxyurea did not significantly (p > .05) affect employment status, but there was a trend for more consistent employment in the hydroxyurea group. Given the fact that patients enrolled in MSH had moderate to severe disease with irreversible complications such as avascular necrosis, if would be attractive to hypothesize that future treatment of young patients with hydroxyurea could prevent or mitigate the incidence of complications of sickle cell anemia and, hence, improve the employment status of treated patients.",

"Linezolid plays an increasingly important role in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). However, patients should be carefully monitored due to time- and dose-dependent toxicity. Clarithromycin plays a more modest role. Therapeutic drug monitoring may contribute to assessment of treatment regimens, helping to reduce toxicity while maintaining adequate drug exposure. Oral fluid sampling could provide a welcome alternative in cases where conventional plasma sampling is not possible or desirable. The aim of this study was to clinically validate the analysis of linezolid and clarithromycin and its metabolite hydroxyclarithromycin in oral fluid of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Serum and oral fluid samples were simultaneously obtained and analyzed by using validated methods, after extensive cross-validation between the two matrices. Passing-Bablok regressions and Bland-Altman analysis showed that oral fluid analysis of linezolid and clarithromycin appeared to be suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring in MDR-TB patients. No correction factor is needed for the interpretation of linezolid oral fluid concentrations with a ratio of the linezolid concentration in serum to that in oral fluid of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.02). However, the clarithromycin concentration serum/clarithromycin concentration in oral fluid ratio is 3.07 (95% CI, 2.45 to 3.69). Analysis of hydroxyclarithromycin in oral fluid was not possible in this study due to a nonlinear relationship between the concentration in serum and that in oral fluid. In conclusion, the analysis of linezolid (no correction factor) and clarithromycin (correction factor of 3) in oral fluid is applicable for therapeutic drug monitoring in cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis as an alternative to conventional serum sampling. Easy sampling using a noninvasive technique may facilitate therapeutic drug monitoring for specific patient categories.",

"Hydroxyurea is one of the most successfully used therapies for sickle cell disease. Results of many clinical trials point to hydroxyurea administration for patients with frequent painful crises and acute chest syndrome. Priapism is one of the complications that could be prevented by hydroxyurea, but there are few reports demonstrating the results. Since November 1993, hydroxyurea has been used in our clinic for preventing priapism in patients with stuttering or major attacks who are still capable of achieving intercourse on demand. Five patients were enrolled in the study, and 4 cases benefited by this treatment. After the initial treatment for the acute attack, all five patients developed stuttering priapism. Hydroxyurea was then introduced at the initial dose of 10 mg/kg, and as the hydroxyurea dosage increased, the number or length of priapism episodes decreased. One to two months after the maximal dose (20-35 mg/kg) was introduced, the episodes disappeared. In two patients, we were forced to administer over 30 mg hydroxyurea/kg to abort the episodes, and, in another patient, 25 mg/kg was necessary. All patients present normal sexual activity. Hydroxyurea was discontinued in two patients, but stuttering priapism reappeared. Hydroxyurea was then re-introduced, and priapism disappeared. One patient, using 20 mg hydroxyurea/kg, had a 6-year remission of priapism after hydroxyurea administration; however, he experienced stuttering priapism, 1 month before a major attack, that progressed to impotence. During that month, he did not seek medical attention. In conclusion, the data here presented suggests that hydroxyurea may prevent priapism attacks in sickle cell disease, probably at higher doses than usually prescribed for painful crisis prevention.",

"The purpose of this study was to test whether the efficacy of prophylactic treatment with botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) on migraine frequency is related to the individual perception of the pain and its directionality, namely, exploding, imploding, or ocular migraine headache. Episodic and chronic migraine patients (n=82) previously treated with BTX-A were interviewed to characterize their migraine headache and its directionality. The magnitude of their response to treatment was analyzed vis-Ã -vis their individual type of headache. Patients showing a >67% drop in number of migraine days/month were classified as responders; those showing a drop smaller than 33% were labeled non-responders; patients showing a drop between 34% and 66% were considered questionable responders. After BTX-A treatment, the number of migraine days/month dropped 85.2+/-1.6% (from 20.1+/-1.5 to 2.8+/-0.4; p<0.0001) in 37 responders, 52.4+/-2.4% (from 16.3+/-3.5 to 7.2+/-1.5; p=0.003) in 11 questionable responders, and remained unchanged (21.2+/-1.8 vs. 21.1+/-1.7; p>0.78) in 34 non-responders. The frequency of headache types differed significantly (p<0.0001) across the 3 response sub-groups. Among non-responders, 83% described a buildup of pressure inside their head (exploding headache). Among responders and questionable responders, 84 and 64%, respectively, perceived their head to be crushed, clamped or stubbed by external forces (imploding headache) or an eye-popping pain (ocular headache). The prevalence of exploding, imploding, and ocular headache was similar between episodic and chronic migraine patients. Imploding/ocular migraine headache is more likely than exploding headache to be prevented by prophylactic BTX-A treatment. Further validation of this principle should await large-scale prospective, placebo-controlled studies.",
"Telcagepant is a novel, orally active, and selective calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist being developed for acute treatment of migraine with and without aura.

Telcagepant was rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum concentration of approximately 1.5 hours. The terminal half-life was approximately 6 hours. A greater than dose-proportional increase was observed in the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from zero to infinity. Following twice-daily dosing, with each dose separated by 2 hours, steady state was achieved in approximately 3 to 4 days with an accumulation ratio of approximately 2. There were no clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic differences when compared across age and gender.

"The HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) is conducting the HPTN 071 (PopART) study in 21 communities in Zambia and South Africa with support from a consortium of funders. HPTN 071 (PopART) is a community-randomized trial of a combination prevention strategy to reduce HIV incidence in the context of the generalized epidemic of southern Africa. The full PopART intervention strategy is anchored in home-based HIV testing and facilitated linkage of HIV-infected persons to care through community health workers and universal antiretroviral therapy for seropositive persons regardless of CD4+ cell count or HIV viral load. To further reduce the risk of HIV acquisition among uninfected individuals, the study aims to expand voluntary medical male circumcision, diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted infections, behavioral counseling, and condom distribution. The full PopART intervention strategy also incorporates promotion of other interventions designed to reduce HIV and tuberculosis transmission, including optimization of the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission and enhanced individual and public health tuberculosis services. Success for the PopART strategy depends on the ability to increase coverage for the study interventions whose uptake is a necessary antecedent to a prevention effect. Processes will be measured to assess the degree of penetration of the interventions into the communities. A randomly sampled population cohort from each community will be used to measure the impact of the PopART strategy on HIV incidence over 3 years. We describe the strategy being tested and progress to date in the HPTN 071 (PopART) study.",

"The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea (HU) in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Thirty-four patients with sickle cell anemia (hemoglobin S [HbS]/HbS), 131 with HbS/beta(0)-thal, and 165 with HbS/beta(+)-thal participated in this trial. HU was administered to 131 patients, whereas 199 patients were conventionally treated. The median follow-up period was 8 years for HU patients and 5 years for non-HU patients. HU produced a dramatic reduction in the frequency of severe painful crises, transfusion requirements, hospital admissions, and incidence of acute chest syndrome. The probability of 10-year survival was 86% and 65% for HU and non-HU patients, respectively (P = .001), although HU patients had more severe forms of SCD. The 10-year probability of survival for HbS/HbS, HbS/beta (0)-thal, and HbS/IVSI-110 patients was 100%, 87%, and 82%, respectively, for HU patients and 10%, 54%, and 66%, for non-HU patients. The multivariate analysis showed that fetal hemoglobin values at baseline and percentage change of lactate dehydrogenase between baseline and 6 months were independently predicted for survival in the HU group.

"Although all weight-loss approaches may improve insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery is believed to be the only reliable means of achieving diabetes remission. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to compare rates of diabetes remission, relapse and all-cause mortality among severely obese individuals with diabetes who underwent bariatric surgery vs. nonsurgically treated individuals. Severely obese adults with uncontrolled or medication-controlled diabetes who underwent bariatric surgery or received usual medical care from 2005 to 2008 in three health care delivery systems in the United States were eligible. Diabetes status was identified using pharmacy, laboratory, and diagnosis information from electronic medical records. A propensity approach and exclusion criteria identified 1395 adults with diabetes who had bariatric surgery and 62,322 who did not. Most procedures were Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (72.0% laparoscopic; 8.2% open); 4.4% were gastric banding, 2.4% sleeve gastrectomy, and 13.2% were other procedures. At two years, bariatric subjects experienced significantly higher diabetes remission rates [73.7% (95% CI: 70.6, 76.5)] compared to nonsurgical subjects [6.9% (95%CI: 6.9, 7.1)]. Age, site, duration of diabetes, hemoglobin A1c level, and intensity of diabetes medication treatment were significantly associated with remission. Bariatric subjects also experienced lower relapse rates than nonsurgical subjects (adjusted HR: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.15-0.23) with no higher risk of death (adjusted HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.22-1.30). We conclude that bariatric surgery can effectively induce remission of diabetes among most severely obese adults, and this treatment approach appears to be superior to nonsurgical treatment in inducing diabetes remission.",

"To analyze the clinical significance of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the assessment of abnormal glucose metabolism in Chinese patients with hypertension. In this cross-sectional study of 10,173 hypertensive adult patients from eight sites in China, data on patient, clinical and disease characteristics were collected, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were measured. A subset of 5322 patients also underwent an OGTT. Abnormal glucose metabolism (impaired glucose regulation (IGR) or diabetes mellitus (DM)) was detected in 31.1% of the 10,173 patients by FPG testing and in 67% of the 5322 patients by OGTT. OGTT increased the detection rate by 35.8%. Patients with FPG levels â¥5.6 and â¥6.1âmmolâl(-1) had the mean OGTT 2-h plasma glucose levels of 8.79 and 9.68âmmolâl(-1), respectively. Compared with normoglycemic patients, those with IGR or DM had higher rates of total proteinuria (normoglycemic 15.8% vs. IGR 22.1% vs. DM 33.7%, P<0.001), a lower absolute estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; in mlâmin(-1) per 1.73âm(2)) (82.9 vs. 80.77 vs. 79.74, P=0.06) and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (normoglycemic 17.6% vs. IGR/DM 13.8%, P<0.001). Abnormal abdominal circumference, eGFR â¤60âmlâmin(-1) per 1.73âm(2), and proteinuria were independently associated with abnormal glucose metabolism (IGR or DM). Hypertensive patients who are diabetic or at risk of diabetes are at greater risk of renal damage and cardiovascular disease than those who are normoglycemic. It is insufficient to assess the glucose metabolism status of Chinese hypertensive patients using only FPG testing; the use of OGTT can increase the detection rate by 35.8%. Patients whose FPG levels were <5.6âmmolâl(-1) may be found to have abnormal glucose metabolism after an OGTT.",

In the maintenance stage (3 months longer after starting therapy), the efficacy of bepridil was significantly higher in patients with Cbep above than below 300 ng/mL (p=0.04). The clinical efficacy of bepridil was closely related to Cbep. The target value of Cbep to obtain a clinical benefit was approximately 300 ng/mL.

"Intravenous enoxaparin did not reduce significantly the primary end point (p = 0.06) compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the randomized Acute Myocardial Infarction Treated with primary angioplasty and intravenous enoxaparin Or unfractionated heparin to Lower ischemic and bleeding events at short- and Long-term follow-up (ATOLL) trial. We present the results of the prespecified per-protocol analysis excluding patients who did not receive the treatment allocated by randomization or received both enoxaparin and UFH. We evaluated all-cause mortality, complication of myocardial infarction, procedural failure, or major bleeding (primary end point) and all-cause mortality, recurrent acute coronary syndrome, or urgent revascularization (main secondary end point). Baseline and procedural characteristics were well balanced between the 2 treatment groups. Of 910 randomized patients, 795 patients (87.4%) were treated according to the protocol with consistent anticoagulation using intravenous enoxaparin (n = 400) or UFH (n = 395). Enoxaparin reduced significantly the rates of the primary end point (relative risk [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62 to 0.94, p = 0.012) and the main secondary end point (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.63, p <0.0001). There was less major bleeding with enoxaparin (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01, p = 0.050) contributing to the significant improvement of the net clinical benefit (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.74, p = 0.0002). All-cause mortality was also reduced with enoxaparin (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.74, p = 0.003). In conclusion, in the per-protocol analysis of the ATOLL trial, pertinent to >87% of the study population, enoxaparin was superior to UFH in reducing ischemic end points and mortality.",
"Diabetes mellitus as one of the most prevalent endocrine disease is associated with high oxidative stress. Anxiety, stress and depression are common neuropsychiatric features in diabetic patients. Hyperglycemia leads to increased oxidative stress which in turn diminishes antioxidant defense system. On the other hand oxidative stress is the leading cause of depression and anxiety disorders. Thus, it seems that diabetes could accelerate the trend of psychiatric diseases. In this randomized single-blind study, evaluation of the effects of two antioxidants (vitamin C and vitamin E) was done on Stress, depression and anxiety levels in 45 diabetic patients for six weeks. The patients were randomly divided in three groups of vitamin E (400 IU day(-1)), vitamin C (1000 mg day(-1)) and placebo. DASS-21 (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21-item) questionnaire items were read to each patient and completed by the main investigator of this study before and after six weeks of supplementation. The scores of depression, anxiety and stress were evaluated separately based on the DASS questionnaire. The results showed a significant decrease in anxiety level (p = 0.005) in vitamin C group compared to other groups but there were no significant differences between groups in terms of changes in stress and depression scores. In conclusion, this study suggests that short-term supplementation of vitamin C is safe and beneficial for reducing anxiety levels in diabetic patients through alleviating oxidative damage.",

"Recently, polyphenols have been found to affect blood lipids in animals in a similar manner as soluble dietary fibre. The aim was to assess whether an insoluble dietary fiber very rich in polyphenols has a beneficial effect on serum lipids in humans. In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical study with parallel arms, 88 volunteers with hypercholesterolemia were randomly assigned to consume daily either, fiber with insoluble 84% polyphenols 4 g twice a day (n = 43) or placebo (n = 45). Serum total, LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were assessed at baseline and after 4 weeks. The insoluble polyphenols consumption reduced the total cholesterol by 17.8 +/- 6.1% (p < 0.05), LDL cholesterol by 22.5 +/- 8.9% (p < 0.001), LDL: HDL cholesterol ratio by 26.2 +/- 14.3% (p < 0.001) and triglycerides by 16.3 +/- 23.4% (p < 0.05) at the end of the study compared with baseline. No significant differences were found during the study time in the placebo group for the lipid profile.

"Iron is a critical and tightly regulated nutrient for both the malaria parasite and its human host. The importance of the relationship between host iron and the parasite has been underscored recently by studies showing that host iron supplementation may increase the risk of falciparum malaria. It is unclear what host iron sources the parasite is able to access. We developed a flow cytometry-based method for measuring the labile iron pool (LIP) of parasitized erythrocytes using the nucleic acid dye STYO 61 and the iron sensitive dye, calcein acetoxymethyl ester (CA-AM). This new approach enabled us to measure the LIP of P.Â falciparum through the course of its erythrocytic life cycle and in response to the addition of host serum iron sources. We found that the LIP increases as the malaria parasite develops from early ring to late schizont stage, and that the addition of either transferrin or ferric citrate to culture media increases the LIP of trophozoites. Our method for detecting the LIP within malaria parasitized RBCs provides evidence that the parasite is able to access serum iron sources as part of the host vs. parasite arms race for iron.",

"It is controversial whether angiotensin II receptor blockers provide better protection than calcium antagonists against atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence in hypertensive patients. This study was designed to compare the effect of nifedipine- and telmisartan-based antihypertensive treatments for preventing AF recurrence in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF. A total of 149 hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF were randomized to nifedipine- or telmisartan-based antihypertensive treatment groups. The target blood pressure (BP) was <130/80 mm Hg. Clinic BP, ECG, Holter monitoring, and echocardiography were followed up for 2 years. The primary end point was the incidence of overall and persistent AF recurrence. During follow-up, there was no statistical difference in the rate of patients lowering to target BP between both groups, whereas nifedipine group had slightly better BP control but similar heart rate control at 24 months. The incidence of AF recurrence was similar in both groups (nifedipine versus telmisartan: 58.7% versus 55.4%; P=0.742), and Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no significant difference in the freedom from AF recurrence (log-rank test; P=0.48). However, the rate of developing persistent AF in telmisartan group was lower than that in nifedipine group (5.4% versus 16.0%; P=0.035). Patients in telmisartan group had lower values of left atrial diameter, left atrial volume index, and left ventricular mass index at the end of follow-up. The effects of telmisartan in preventing AF recurrences in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF after intensive lowering BP is similar to that of nifedipine, but telmisartan has more potent effects on preventing progression to persistent AF.",

"To document the rate of self-reported compliance and glaucoma-related knowledge in Swiss patients and to identify risk factors for their poor compliance. This was an observational study, including a total of 200 consecutive patients already under glaucoma medication in two Swiss tertiary glaucoma clinics (Geneva and Bern). Personal characteristics, presence of systemic disease, compliance with glaucoma medication, attitude to the ophthalmologist, and glaucoma-related attitudes were ascertained by means of a predetermined questionnaire with 40 questions. Patients were subsequently assessed for the ability to correctly instil placebo eye drops. Non-compliance with glaucoma medication was defined as omitting more than two doses a week as reported by the patient. Logistic regression was used to evaluate how patient characteristics and knowledge about the disease were related to compliance. Overall, 81% (nÂ =Â 162) of patients reported to be compliant. Forgetfulness was the most frequently cited reason for non-compliance with dosing regimen (63%). Although 90.5% (nÂ =Â 181) of patients believed glaucoma medication to be efficient, only 28% (nÂ =Â 56) could correctly define glaucoma. Factors positively associated with compliance were 'knowledge of glaucoma' [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 4.77 (95% CI 1.36-16.70)] and 'getting help for administration of drops' [OR 2.95 (1.25-6.94)]. These findings indicate that despite the comparatively high compliance rate among glaucoma patients, knowledge of glaucoma remains poor in long-term glaucoma sufferers. Improving knowledge about the disease is important since it is positively associated with compliance in our study.",

We sought to compare the predictive performance of bleeding risk-estimation tools in a cohort of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing PCI. Management of patients with AF undergoing coronary artery stenting is a multicenter European prospective registry enrolling patients with AF undergoing PCI. We calculated HAS-BLED, ATRIA, mOBRI, and REACH bleeding risk-prediction scores and assessed the rate of bleeding complications as defined by Bleeding Academic Research Consortium at 12 months follow-up in 929 consecutive patients undergoing PCI. Increasing age, femoral access site, and previous peptic ulcer were independent determinants of bleeding. Low bleeding risk scores as determined by HAS-BLED 0 to 2, ATRIA 0 to 3, mOBRI 0, and REACH 0 to 10 were detected in 23.7%, 73.0%, 7.8%, and 5.7% of patients of the cohort, respectively. No significant differences were detected in the rates of any bleeding or major bleeding events for low versus intermediate/high scores with each risk-prediction tool. In conclusion, the performance of ATRIA, HAS-BLED, mOBRI, and REACH scores in predicting bleeding complications in this high-risk patient subset was useless.",

"Hydroxyurea (HU) enhances the synthesis of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and can improve the clinical course of some adult patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). In a randomized trial, we studied the biologic effects and the clinical benefit of HU in children and young adults with severe SCA. Twenty-five patients (median age, 9 years) were randomized to receive either HU (at the initial dosage of 20 mg/kg/d) or a placebo for 6 months and were then switched to the other arm for the next 6 months. Among the 22 evaluable patients (median age, 8 years), significant increases in HbF and mean corpuscular volume occurred during the HU treatment period. The white blood cell and reticulocytes counts decreased significantly, but these changes were not clinically relevant. Sixteen of 22 patients (73%) experienced a complete disappearance of events requiring hospitalization. The number of days of hospitalization as well as the number of hospitalizations for patients on HU, as compared with those for the patients receiving placebo, were significantly reduced. We conclude that treatment with HU in children and young adults is feasible, well-tolerated, and improves the clinical course of SCA. The long-term effects of HU require further investigation.",

"Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are effective for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but are difficult to use. Dabigatran etexilate is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. It is administered in a fixed dose without laboratory monitoring and is being compared with warfarin (international normalized ratio 2-3) in the RE-LY trial. Two doses of dabigatran (110 and 150 mg BID) are being evaluated. RE-LY is a phase 3, prospective, randomized, open-label multinational (44 countries) trial of patients with nonvalvular AF and at least 1 risk factor for stroke. Recruitment concluded with a total of 18,113 patients. Patients who were VKA-naive and experienced are included in balanced proportions. The primary outcome is stroke (including hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism. Safety outcomes are bleeding, liver function abnormalities, and other adverse events. Adjudication of end points is blinded to drug assignment. The trial is expected to accrue a minimum of 450 events with a minimum 1-year of follow-up. RE-LY is the largest AF stroke prevention trial yet undertaken. It is unique because it includes equal numbers of VKA-experienced and naive patients and evaluates 2 different dosages of dabigatran, which may allow tailoring of dosing to individual patient needs. The worldwide site distribution and broad range of stroke risk further increase the general applicability of the trial. Results are expected in 2009.",

"In randomized trials, low-dose (LD) and high-dose (HD) aspirin (ASA) are equally effective in reducing ischemic complications, but HD ASA is associated with an increased risk of bleeding in the setting of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). ASA dose after PCI varies across countries, but little is known about variation within the United States (US) and whether this variation can be explained by clinical characteristics of patients. We used enrollment data from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Study, a randomized trial designed to compare 12 versus 30Â months of dual antiplatelet therapy after PCI, to quantify the variation in ASA dosing after PCI in the US subjects and assess the extent to which dose variability was attributable to patient characteristics. Of the 23,336 patients enrolled in the US, 28.0% were prescribed LD ASA at discharge after PCI. Patient characteristics explained 1.6% of total variance in ASA dose, whereas the study site accounted for 45.9% of the unexplained variability. The median odds ratio comparing sites was 5.05 (95% confidence interval 4.29 to 5.85), which was greater than any individual predictor of ASA dose. In conclusion, LD ASA after PCI in the US was used in a minority of patients, and heterogeneity in its selection was mainly influenced by the site of enrollment rather than patient characteristics. As HD ASA may be associated with adverse events in the setting of dual antiplatelet therapy, reducing local practice variation in the dose of ASA may be a target for quality improvement.",

"AIDS, caused by the retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the leading cause of death of economically active people (age, 15-59 years) in sub-Saharan Africa. The host genetic variability of immune response to HIV and immune reconstitution following initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is poorly understood. Here we focused on copy number variation of the Î²-defensin genes, which have been shown to have anti-HIV activity, and are important chemoattractants for Th17 lymphocytes via the chemokine receptor CCR6. We determined Î²-defensin gene copy number for 1002 Ethiopian and Tanzanian patients. We show that higher Î²-defensin copy number variation is associated with increased HIV load prior to HAART (P=.005) and poor immune reconstitution following initiation of HAART (P=.003). We suggest a model where variable amounts of Î²-defensin expression by mucosal cells, due to gene copy number variation, alters the efficacy of recruitment of Th17 lymphocytes to the site of infection, altering the dynamics of infection.",

"The present study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of low-dose topiramate and compare it with sodium valproate that is prevalently prescribed as a migraine prophylaxis. This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial on 56 patients who completed the course of study. Topiramate and valproate were administered at 50 mg/day and 400 mg/day, respectively, during the follow-up period. Frequency, intensity, duration, associated symptoms with headaches, analgesics use, as well as drugs' side effects were studied. Participants completed MIDAS and HIT-6 questionnaires before and after treatment. Frequency, intensity, and duration of migraine headaches as well as MIDAS score and symptomatic medications decreased significantly between repeated follow-up visits in both groups. Responder rate for patients treated with topiramate and valproate were 71.6% and 64.3%, respectively, and the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The reduction of headache severity in the topiramate group was significantly more than that in the valproate group (p = .027). During the study, no statistically significant reduction in associated symptoms with migraine were observed in both the groups. Topiramate dose of 50 mg/day with fewer side effects in comparison with its higher doses may be an appropriate substitution for first-line migraine prophylaxis such as valproate.",

"The efficacy of a 6-day regimen of frovatriptan for menstrual migraine (MM; attacks starting on day -2 to +3 of menses) prevention in women with difficult-to-treat MM was assessed. Women with a documented inadequate response to triptans for acute MM treatment were included in this placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. Women were randomized to double-blind treatment for three perimenstrual periods (PMPs) with either frovatriptan 2.5 mg (q.d. or b.i.d.) or placebo initiated 2 days before anticipated MM. The efficacy analysis included 410 women with 85% completing three double-blind PMPs. The mean number of headache-free PMPs was 0.92 with frovatriptan b.i.d., 0.69 with frovatriptan q.d. and 0.42 with placebo [P < 0.001 (b.i.d.) and P < 0.02 (q.d.) vs. placebo]. When migraine occurred, severity was reduced with frovatriptan q.d. (P < 0.001) and b.i.d. (P < 0.001) vs. placebo. Both frovatriptan regimens were well tolerated. In women with difficult-to-treat MM, a 6-day regimen of frovatriptan significantly reduced MM incidence and severity.",

"Of the patients, 27% were female (age 72.1 Â± 12.6 years) and 73% were male (64.2 Â± 12.9 years). 46.8% had comorbidities and they were less likely to receive guideline-recommended drug therapy and reperfusion. Heart failure (adjusted OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.57 to 2.25), metastatic tumours (OR 2.25; 95% CI 1.60 to 3.19), renal diseases (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.11) and diabetes (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.19 to 1.54) were strong predictors of in-hospital mortality.

"This study primarily included subjects whose migraines significantly impacted their lives. Before the study, these subjects used butalbital-containing medications as part of their current migraine treatment regimen and were satisfied with it, suggesting they were butalbital responders who had found a workable treatment strategy for themselves.

"Calcidiol, the major circulating metabolite of vitamin D, supports induction of pleiotropic antimicrobial responses in vitro. Vitamin D supplementation elevates circulating calcidiol concentrations, and thus has a potential role in the prevention and treatment of infection. The immunomodulatory effects of administering vitamin D to humans with an infectious disease have not previously been reported. To characterize these effects, we conducted a detailed longitudinal study of circulating and antigen-stimulated immune responses in ninety-five patients receiving antimicrobial therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis who were randomized to receive adjunctive high-dose vitamin D or placebo in a clinical trial, and who fulfilled criteria for per-protocol analysis. Vitamin D supplementation accelerated sputum smear conversion and enhanced treatment-induced resolution of lymphopaenia, monocytosis, hypercytokinaemia, and hyperchemokinaemia. Administration of vitamin D also suppressed antigen-stimulated proinflammatory cytokine responses, but attenuated the suppressive effect of antimicrobial therapy on antigen-stimulated secretion of IL-4, CC chemokine ligand 5, and IFN-Î±. We demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for vitamin D supplementation in accelerating resolution of inflammatory responses during tuberculosis treatment. Our findings suggest a potential role for adjunctive vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of pulmonary infections to accelerate resolution of inflammatory responses associated with increased risk of mortality.",
"BCG revaccination is still used in some tuberculosis endemic countries. Until now, the little evidence available suggested that BCG revaccination confers very limited additional protection, although there was no information on whether protection depends on the setting and age of revaccination, or if protection increases with time since vaccination. Here we report on an extended follow up of the BCG-REVAC trial, a cluster randomised trial conducted in the Brazilian cities Salvador and Manaus including over 200,000 children aged 7-14 years aimed to evaluate the efficacy of BCG revaccination in children who had received neonatal BCG vaccination. With the extended follow-up (9 years) and the additional cases accrued we now have enough power to report vaccine efficacy separately for the two cities (with different distances from Equator and presumably different prevalence of non-tuberculosis mycobacteria), and by age at vaccination and clinical form. The overall vaccine efficacy was 12% (-2 to 24%) as compared to 9% (-16 to 29%) for the 5-year follow up. Vaccine efficacy was higher in Salvador (19%, 3 to 33%) than in Manaus (1%, -27 to 27%) with the highest vaccine efficacy in children from Salvador aged <11 years at revaccination (33%, 3 to 54%). The findings are in line with the hypothesis that BCG vaccination offers higher efficacy in low NTMb prevalence, and show that revaccination with BCG can offer weak protection in selected subgroups.",

"The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation using the Edwards SAPIEN valve and the Medtronic CoreValve in patients with annulus of intermediate size (20 to 25 mm). From October 2008 to April 2012, 662 consecutive patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation were studied at 2 French centers. After propensity score matching, a total of 192 patients with intermediate-sized aortic annulus who had received either Edwards (n = 96, mean age 82.4 Â± 7.9 years, 48% men, 61.9% receiving the 26-mm valve) or CoreValve (n = 96, mean age 82.5 Â± 7.7 years, 50% men, 64.6% receiving the 29-mm valve) prostheses through the transfemoral approach were studied. Adequate reduction in postprocedural mean pressure gradients was achieved with the Edwards valve and the CoreValve (10.9 Â± 4.7 vs 9.1 Â± 4.4 mm Hg, respectively, p <0.01). Major vascular complications (5.2% vs 3.1%, p = 0.36), device success (95.8% vs 93.8%, p = 0.52), and 30-day survival (90.6% vs 89.6%, p = 0.81) were similar. The incidence of postprocedural aortic regurgitation grade â¥2/4 and new pacemaker implantation was more frequent in the CoreValve group (14.3% vs 35.5%, p <0.01, and 4.2% vs 18.8%, p <0.01, respectively). There was no significant difference in 1-year cumulative survival rates in the Edwards valve group compared with the CoreValve group (80.1 Â± 4.2% vs 75.6 Â± 4.9%, log-rank p = 0.31). In conclusion, in patients with annulus of intermediate size, similar device success and short-term and midterm outcomes were achieved with either of the valves, irrespective of the specific complications related to each valve.",
"Our previous work on the immune-endocrine features of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) showed markedly decreased plasma levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) together with augmented concentrations of Cortisol and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) indicated a lower mRNA Î±/Î² ratio of glucocorticoid receptors -GR- together with a higher 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11Î²HSD1) mRNA expression in cases with severe pulmonary TB. Since Pleural TB (PLTB) is a rather benign manifestation of TB, we now analyzed the systemic and local immune-endocrine profile as well as the GRÎ±, GRÎ², 11Î²HSD1 and 11Î²HSD2 transcripts in PBMC and pleural effusion mononuclear cells (PEMC) of patients with PLTB. PLTB patients had increased levels of IL-1Î², IL-6 and IFNÎ³ together with reduced Cortisol and DHEA concentrations in pleural fluids. Also, a significantly increased expression of 11Î²HSD1 and GRÎ± was found in PEMC compared to PBMC. Findings point out to an appropriate immune response and a substantial inflammatory reaction, wherein the low Cortisol concentrations may be equally effective, because of the increased expression of GRÎ± and 11Î²HSD1 transcripts which may optimize the immunomodulatory properties of Cortisol.",

"Converging in vitro evidence and clinical data indicate that oxidative stress may play important roles in Plasmodium falciparum malaria, notably in the pathogenesis of severe anaemia. However, oxidative modifications of the red blood cell (RBC)-membrane by 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and haemoglobin-binding, previously hypothesized to contribute mechanistically to the pathogenesis of clinical malaria, have not yet been tested for clinical significance. In 349 non-immune Mozambican newborns recruited in a double-blind placebo-controlled chemoprophylaxis trial, oxidative markers including 4-HNE-conjugates and membrane-bound haemoglobin were longitudinally assessed from 2Â·5 to 24Â months of age, at first acute malaria episode and in convalescence. During acute malaria, 4-HNE-conjugates were shown to increase significantly in parasitized and non-parasitized RBCs. In parallel, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) rose in plasma. 4-HNE-conjugates correlated with AOPP and established plasma but not with RBC oxidative markers. High individual levels of 4-HNE-conjugates were predictive for increased malaria incidence rates in children until 2Â years of life and elevated 4-HNE-conjugates in convalescence accompanied sustained anaemia after a malaria episode, indicating 4-HNE-conjugates as a novel patho-mechanistic factor in malaria. A second oxidative marker, haemoglobin binding to RBC-membranes, hypothesized to induce clearing of RBCs from circulation, was predictive for lower malaria incidence rates. Further studies will show whether or not higher membrane-haemoglobin values at the first malaria episode may provide protection against malaria.",

"Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are associated with a high risk for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) despite statin treatment. The impact of combined bezafibrate and statin therapy in patients with DM and ACS has not been specifically investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of combined therapy with 30-day MACEs in patients with DM participating in the nationwide Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Surveys (ACSIS). The study population comprised 3,063 patients with DM from the ACSIS 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010 enrollment waves who were alive at discharge and received statins. Of these, 225 (7.3%) received on discharge combined bezafibrate and statin therapy, and 2,838 (92.7%) were treated with statins alone. MACEs were defined as a composite measure of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, recurrent ischemia, stent thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and urgent revascularization. The development of 30-day MACEs was recorded in 8% patients receiving combination therapy and 14.2% of those receiving statins alone (p = 0.01). Crude 1-year mortality and 30-day rehospitalization rates were also significantly lower in patients receiving combination therapy: 4.0% versus 8.1% (p = 0.03) and 13.3% versus 21.6% (p = 0.003), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified combined therapy as an independent predictor of reduced risk for 30-day MACEs, with an odds ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.92), corresponding to a 44% relative risk reduction. In conclusion, a significantly lower risk for 30-day MACEs was observed in statin-treated patients with DM who also received bezafibrate after ACS. Signals regarding improvement of 30-day rehospitalization and 1-year mortality rates emerged as well.",

A meta-analysis of data from the Silent Infarct Transfusion Trial (nâ=â456) and the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (nâ=â764), demonstrated that baseline HbF levels were associated with the incidence of severe pain, commonly defined across studies as an event requiring hospitalization (P-valueâ=â0.02).",

"Clinical experience on meropenem-clavulanate to treat tuberculosis (TB) is anecdotal (according to case reports on 10 patients). The aim of our case-control study was to evaluate the contribution of meropenem-clavulanate when added to linezolid-containing regimens in terms of efficacy and safety/tolerability in treating multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases after 3 months of second-line treatment. 37 cases with MDR-/XDR-TB were prescribed meropenem-clavulanate (3 g daily dose) in addition to a linezolid-containing regimen (dosage range 300-1200 mgÂ·day(-1)), designed according to international guidelines, which was prescribed to 61 controls. The clinical severity of cases was worse than that of controls (drug susceptibility profile, proportion of sputum-smear positive and of re-treatment cases). The group of cases yielded a higher proportion of sputum-smear converters (28 (87.5%) out of 32 versus nine (56.3%) out of 16; p=0.02) and culture converters (31 (83.8%) out of 37 versus 15 (62.5%) out of 24; p=0.06). Excluding XDR-TB patients (11 (11.2%) out of 98), cases scored a significantly higher proportion of culture converters than controls (p=0.03). One case had to withdraw from meropenem-clavulanate due to increased transaminase levels. The results of our study provide: 1) preliminary evidence on effectiveness and safety/tolerability of meropenem-clavulanate; 2) reference to design further trials; and 3) a guide to clinicians for its rationale use within salvage/compassionate regimens.",

"In Latin America, indigenous populations have high rates of non-completion of TB treatment and case fatality and have been defined as a priority group for investments. To evaluate TB control, a retrospective cohort study was performed to identify factors predictive of non-completion of treatment and mortality in an indigenous and non-indigenous population between 2002 and 2008 in Dourados, Brazil. A 90% reduction in non-completion of TB treatment was observed in the indigenous population after DOTS (directly observed treatment, short course) implementation (20% vs 2%). In the non-indigenous population, the number of patients not completing TB treatment continued to increase. Non-indigenous TB patients had 4.5 times higher mortality than indigenous TB patients (9% vs 2%). In multivariate analysis, non-indigenous race [odds ratio (OR) 2.33, 95% CI 1.32-4.10] was associated with non-completion of TB treatment, and HIV-positive status (OR 5.58, 95% CI 2.38-13.07) was associated with mortality. Implementation of DOTS in the indigenous populations in Dourados showed a significant reduction in non-completion of TB treatment. Nevertheless, a high rate of TB in children and young adults indicates the continuous transmission and maintenance of the epidemic in this community. Among the non-indigenous population, the TB case fatality rate is closely linked to the HIV prevalence.",

Herein, we reviewed MDR-TB cases in which treatment regimens, with/without delamanid, were administered. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled; 26 received delamanid-containing regimens (treatment group) while 12 received placebo-containing regimens (control group) for 56 days. Data regarding clinical/radio-microbiological characteristics, drug tolerability, and treatment outcomes were collected. We found that all patients had isolates resistant to a median of 5 (range 2-7) drugs; 24 (92.3%) patients in treatment group and 11 (91.7%) in control group had cavities. Culture conversion was obtained in 32 pulmonary TB cases (median 74.5 days). At data censure, 30/38 patients successfully completed therapy with documented negative cultures for at least 18 months before the end of treatment. Two patients (5 consecutive negative cultures) are still on treatment. Six patients had poor outcome (3 failures/2 lost/1 death). In 13 patients, adverse events were observed that included mental disorder, QT interval prolongation, and increased blood cortisol whereas only 3 patients stopped delamanid treatment because of adverse events. It was, therefore, concluded that delamanid was well-tolerated, had low rates of discontinuation, and could be effective for treating MDR-TB.",

"The antisickling action on polymerization of 4-hydroxy-3-metoxybenzaldehyde (Vanillin) was demonstrated in vivo in a double blind, placebo-controlled clinical therapeutic trial performed in 30 patients (11 belonging to the control group), through the increment of the delay time (td). The td was observed in the kinetic curve of the polymerization of the Hb S solution at 26 degrees C and pH 7.4. The kinetics of the Hb S aliquots was monitored by measuring the proton spin-spin magnetic relaxation time (T2) at 4 MHz. The kinetic curve families of the control group showed similarities and the td values remained constant during the 8 weeks of the study. This was not so for the patients treated with Vanillin, for which the td increased on average 1.6 times. On the other hand, the relative variation of drepanocytes observed by the Simple Test decreased 24.50% Both results indicate a decrease in the effectiveness of the polymerization process.",
"Hydroxyurea has been shown to increase fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) production in patients with sickle cell disease and therefore has the potential to alleviate both the hemolytic and vaso-occlusive manifestations of the disease. Preliminary evidence indicates that recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) may also induce Hb F. Three sickle cell anemia patients were treated with escalating doses of intravenous rhEpo and, subsequently, with daily oral hydroxyurea. After the optimal hydroxyurea dose was attained, rhEpo was added again. Two additional patients were treated with hydroxyurea alone. Treatment with rhEp, either alone or in combination with hydroxyurea, had no significant effect on the percentage of F reticulocytes or F cells. In contrast, hydroxyurea treatment was associated with a 1.5-fold to sevenfold increase in F cells and a 2.3- to 27-fold increase in the percentage of Hb F. In the three patients whose response reached a plateau, hydroxyurea treatment was associated with lessened hemolysis, decreased serum bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and prolonged 51chromium-labeled RBC survival. Hydroxyurea treatment also resulted in decreased numbers of irreversibly sickled cells and in decreased sickling at partial oxygen saturation, increased oxygen affinity, increased total RBC cation content, and diminished potassium:chloride co-transport. All five patients treated with hydroxyurea experienced a decrease in severity and frequency of painful sickle crises. This study confirms that hydroxyurea therapy increases Hb F production and provides objective evidence of a significant reduction in hemolytic rate and intracellular polymerization. In contrast, rhEpo, either alone or in combination with hydroxyurea, offered no measurable benefit. Based on these encouraging preliminary data, large-scale, controlled clinical trials are warranted to study the safety and efficacy of hydroxyurea in the treatment of sickle cell disease.",
"AZD0837 is an investigational oral anticoagulant which is converted to the active form, AR-H067637, a selective direct thrombin inhibitor. The present study, a multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, dose-guiding study, assessed the safety and tolerability of an immediate-release formulation of AZD0837 compared with dose-adjusted warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolic events in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Two hundred fifty AF patients with at least one additional risk factor for stroke were randomised to receive either immediate-release AZD0837 (150mg twice daily [bid] or 350mg bid, blinded treatment) or dose-adjusted warfarin (international normalised ratio 2.0-3.0, open treatment) for three months. The safety and tolerability of 150mg bid AZD0837 appeared to be as good as that of warfarin. Total bleeding events were six with 150mg bid AZD0837, 15 with 350mg bid AZD0837 and eight with warfarin. Alanine aminotransferase elevations (>3xupper limit of normal) were infrequent, without apparent differences between treatment groups. A numerically higher incidence of serious adverse events was observed with 350mg bid AZD0837 compared with 150mg bid, with six of 13 being cardiac related, all with different diagnoses. An increase in mean serum creatinine of approximately 10% was observed in both AZD0837 groups, which returned to baseline after completion of therapy. There were no strokes, transient ischaemic attacks or cerebral haemorrhages with any of the treatments. In conclusion, the safety and tolerability of 150mg bid immediate-release AZD0837 appeared to be as good as that of dose-adjusted warfarin. However, larger studies will be needed to define the safety profile of AZD0837.",

"Echo-derived pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) and right ventricular (RV) tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE; from the end of diastole to end-systole) are of basic relevance in the clinical follow-up of heart failure (HF) patients, carrying two- to threefold increase in cardiac risk when increased and reduced, respectively. We hypothesized that the relationship between TAPSE (longitudinal RV fiber shortening) and PASP (force generated by the RV) provides an index of in vivo RV length-force relationship, with their ratio better disclosing prognosis. Two hundred ninety-three HF patients with reduced (HFrEF, n = 247) or with preserved left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (HFpEF, n = 46) underwent echo-Doppler studies and N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide assessment and were tracked for adverse events. The median follow-up duration was 20.8 mo. TAPSE vs. PASP relationship showed a downward regression line shift in nonsurvivors who were more frequently presenting with higher PASP and lower TAPSE. HFrEF and HFpEF patients exhibited a similar distribution along the regression line. Given the TAPSE, PASP, and TAPSE-to-PASP ratio (TAPSE/PASP) collinearity, separate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed: one with TAPSE and PASP as individual measures, and the other combining them in ratio form. Hazard ratios for variables retained in the multivariate regression were as follows: TAPSE/PASP </â¥ 0.36 mm/mmHg [hazard ratio (HR): 10.4, P < 0.001]; TAPSE </â¥ 16 mm (HR: 5.1, P < 0.01); New York Heart Association functional class </â¥ 3 (HR: 4.4, P < 0.001); E/e' (HR: 4.1, P < 0.001). This study shows that the TAPSE vs. PASP relationship is shifted downward in nonsurvivors with a similar distribution in HFrEF and HFpEF, and their ratio improves prognostic resolution. The TAPSE vs. PASP relationship as a possible index of the length-force relationship may be a step forward for a more efficient RV function evaluation and is not affected by the quality of LV dysfunction.",

We conducted a cross-sectional study of adults with AF listed as the primary ED diagnosis in the 2007 to 2009 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample. We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses investigating the associations between prespecified patient and hospital characteristics with hospitalization. From 2007 to 2009, there were 1,320,123 weighted ED visits for AF, with 69% hospitalized nationally. Mean regional hospitalization proportions were: Northeast (74%), Midwest (68%), South (74%), and West (57%). The highest odds ratios for predicting hospitalization were heart failure (3.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.66 to 4.02), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.47, 95% CI 2.34 to 2.61), and coronary artery disease (1.65, 95% CI 1.58 to 1.73). After adjusting for age, privately insured (0.77, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.81) and self-pay (0.77 95% CI 0.66 to 0.90) patients had lower odds compared with Medicare recipients, whereas Medicaid (1.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.32) patients tended to have higher odds. Patients living in low-income zip codes (1.18, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.25) and patients treated at large metropolitan hospitals (1.75, 95% CI 1.59 to 1.93) had higher odds. In conclusion, our analysis showed considerable regional variation in the management of patients with AF in the ED and in associations between patient socioeconomic and hospital characteristics with ED disposition; adapting best practices from among these variations in management could reduce hospitalizations and health-care expenses.",
"In this short-term multicentric study, latanoprost effectively reduced IOP and stabilised the diurnal curve in Indian eyes. There were no clinically significant ocular or systemic adverse effects.",
"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an independent predictor of mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We analyzed the relation between biomarkers linked to myocardial stretch (NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]), myocardial damage (Troponin-T [TnT]), and inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]) and new-onset AF during AMI to identify patients at high risk for AF. In a prospective multicenter registry of AMI patients (from the Translational Research Investigating Underlying disparities in recovery from acute Myocardial infarction: Patients' Health status registry), we measured NT-proBNP, TnT, and hs-CRP in patients without a history of AF (n = 2,370). New-onset AF was defined as AF that occurred during the index hospitalization. Hierarchical multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the association of biomarkers with new-onset AF, after adjusting for other covariates. New-onset AF was documented in 114 patients with AMI (4.8%; mean age 58 years; 32% women). For each twofold increase in NT-proBNP, there was an 18% increase in the rate of AF (odds ratio [OR] 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03 to 1.35; p <0.02). Similarly, for every twofold increase in hs-CRP, there was a 15% increase in the rate of AF (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.30; p = 0.02). TnT was not independently associated with new-onset AF (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.07; p = 0.3). NT-proBNP and hs-CRP were independently associated with new in-hospital AF after MI, in both men and women, irrespective of race. Our study suggests that markers of myocardial stretch and inflammation, but not the amount of myocardial necrosis, are important determinants of AF in the setting of AMI.",
"A fixed combination of Travoprost 0.004% and Timolol 0.5% is as effective as a fixed combination of Latanoprost 0.005% and Timolol 0.5% and are better than Timolol 0.5% in 24-hour IOP control.",
"Regular supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is frequently encountered in clinical practice. Guidelines are available from the National Service Framework (NSF) for the treatment of patients attending emergency departments (ED) with SVT. These recommend a thyroid-function test (TFT) and arrhythmia electrocardiography (ECG), and referral to a heart-rhythm specialist on discharge. Hospital admission is rarely required. In our multicentre study, we examined the implementation of these guidelines among patients attending the ED with SVT. Only 34% of patients had specialist referrals, with an average wait of 50.3 days (the majority of delays resulted from referral requests from general practitioners). A history of previous SVT, the mode of tachycardia termination, patient age and/or comorbidities were similar for the 27 (23.5%) patients who were admitted overnight. Of these, 15 (13%) of the total 115 patients who attended ED with regular SVT were referred for Holter monitoring despite having ECGs demonstrating arrhythmia. Low referral rates, unnecessary investigations and admissions indicate a need for improvement for better patient care and to minimise healthcare costs. We have formulated a standard operating procedure, which will be available via the College of Emergency Medicine website.",
"Chromaffin granule transmitters such as chromogranin A and catecholamines have been used in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, but the diagnostic and prognostic value of chromogranin A have not been explored in malignant pheochromocytoma. We evaluated these transmitters in patients with pheochromocytoma (n=27), both benign (n=13) and malignant (n=14). Patients with benign pheochromocytoma were studied before and after surgical excision (n=6), whereas patients with malignant pheochromocytoma were evaluated before and after combination chemotherapy with regular cycles of cyclophosphamide/dacarbazine/vincristine (nonrandomized trial in n=9). During treatment, patient responses to chemotherapy were divided according to anatomic and clinical criteria: responders (n=5) versus nonresponders (n=4). Plasma chromogranin A rose progressively (P<0.0001) from control subjects (48.0+/-3.0 ng/mL) to benign pheochromocytoma (188+/-40.5 ng/mL) to malignant pheochromocytoma (2932+/-960 ng/mL). Parallel changes were seen for plasma norepinephrine (P<0.0001), though plasma epinephrine was actually lower in malignant than benign pheochromocytoma (P=0.0182). In bivariate analyses, chromogranin A, norepinephrine, and epinephrine discriminated between pheochromocytoma and control subjects (all P<0.0001), whereas in a multivariate analyses, norepinephrine was the best discriminator (P:=0.011). Chromogranin A was significantly different in benign versus malignant pheochromocytoma on both bivariate (P=0.0003) and multivariate (P:=0.011) analyses. After excision of benign pheochromocytoma, chromogranin A (P=0.028), norepinephrine (P=0.047), and epinephrine (P=0.037) all fell to values near normal. During chemotherapy of malignant pheochromocytoma (n=9), plasma chromogranin A (P=0.047) and norepinephrine (P=0.02) fell but not epinephrine. In 5 responders to chemotherapy, there were significant declines in chromogranin A (P=0.03) and norepinephrine (P=0.03) but not epinephrine; in 4 nonresponders, none of the transmitters changed. Plasma chromogranin A varied longitudinally with tumor response and relapse. We conclude that plasma chromogranin A is an effective tool in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, and markedly elevated chromogranin A may point to malignant pheochromocytoma. During chemotherapy of malignant pheochromocytoma, chromogranin A can be used to gauge tumor response and relapse.",
"Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Treated-baseline mean IOPs at both timepoints were similar between groups (p > or = 0.606). Brimonidine-purite 0.1% provided IOP-lowering that was non-inferior to brimonidine-purite 0.15% at each of the 12 follow-up timepoints, and there were no statistically significant between-group differences at any timepoint. The most commonly reported adverse event was conjunctival hyperemia (13.5% for brimonidine-purite 0.1%; 10.8% for brimonidine-purite 0.15%). No significant differences in the incidence of adverse events were noted between the two formulations.",

"At 7 years of follow-up after initial enrollment, the cumulative rate of death from any cause among patients with left bundle-branch block was 18% among patients randomly assigned to CRT-D, as compared with 29% among those randomly assigned to defibrillator therapy alone (adjusted hazard ratio in the CRT-D group, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.80; P<0.001). The long-term survival benefit of CRT-D in patients with left bundle-branch block did not differ significantly according to sex, cause of cardiomyopathy, or QRS duration. In contrast, CRT-D was not associated with any clinical benefit and possibly with harm in patients without left bundle-branch block (adjusted hazard ratio for death from any cause, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.39; P=0.04; P<0.001 for interaction of treatment with QRS morphologic findings).",
"The effects of long-term aspirin for the treatment of sickle cell disease were compared with placebo in a double-blind trial completed by 29 patients.

"The Seldinger technique is commonly used to change central venous access catheters in the Intensive Care Unit. These catheters are routinely being changed to prevent septic complications. Some of these changes are performed by an "over-wire" technique. To assess the utility of postprocedural chest X-rays on critically ill patients after an over-wire catheter change, we followed 68 patients after they had 80 catheter changes. This study assesses catheter position by use of a postprocedural X-ray. During the study, we found no misplaced catheters and minimum symptomatology in 80 patients. The trauma/critical care fellows performing the procedures rated them as easy in 97.5 percent of the changes. The conclusion of the study is that, if the catheter change is technically easy and the patient has no symptoms, a postprocedural X-ray is not necessary.",
"Cohort review has been used internationally to support tuberculosis (TB) control. We describe its first use in the UK by a London TB service. Improvements were noted in case management and contact tracing, weaknesses identified and important service changes put in place. Key areas of impact were directly observed therapy (DOT) provision (a greater proportion of cases offered DOT, and in response to low uptake resources diverted to create posts responsible for patient-centred DOT delivery), and contact tracing (more contacts per case screened and assessed). Cohort review enables whole system review and improvement. It has subsequently been adopted across the UK.",

"Despite the initial enthusiasm, the significant number of patients in whom sildenafil is contraindicated or ineffective is a major challenge to all urologists. Our aim was to determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive atorvastatin in restoring normal erectile function in hypercholesterolemic (low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol >120 mg per 100 ml) sildenafil nonresponders. The study comprised 131 men with ED not responding to sildenafil citrate. They were randomized either to 40 mg atorvastatin daily (n=66, group 1) or matching placebo (n=65, group 2) for 12 weeks while they were taking on-demand 100 mg sildenafil. Erectile function was subjectively assessed using the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire and response to the global efficacy question (GEQ). Serum biochemical and lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) analyses were performed at baseline and repeated at post-treatment weeks 6 and 12. Compared with the placebo group (59 patients, mean age+/-s.d. 61.9+/-6.1, mean years ED 3.9+/-1.8), the atorvastatin group (59 patients, mean age+/-s.d. 63.9+/-6.9, mean years ED 3.7+/-1.6) had significantly greater improvements in all IIEF-5 questions (P=0.01) and GEQ (P=0.001). Subgroup analyses did reveal trends in the atorvastatin group to indicate that a change in the IIEF-5 score is affected by age, severity of ED and baseline serum levels of LDL. Patients with moderate (r=0.28, P=0.01) and severe (r=0.20, P=0.01) ED had better positive response rates to adjunctive atorvastatin than patients with mild to moderate ED. None of the patients taking atorvastatin achieved a response of 5 to the IIEF-5 questions and none of the patients regained normal erectile function as defined by the IIEF-5 score >21. Subjects experienced a statistically significant but modest improvement in erectile function. Further investigation is needed to test the usefulness of long-term atorvastatin administration to restore erectile function in sildenafil nonresponders.",
"We conducted an open, randomized clinical trial of oral dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) versus artesunate-mefloquine (AM) in 300 patients in Laos with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria as part of a multicentre study in Asia. Survival analysis and adjustment for re-infection showed that the 63-day cure rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) were 100% for AM and 99.5% (96.4-99.8%) for DP. The 63-day cure rates per protocol were 99% (97 of 98) for AM and 99.5% (196 of 197) for DP (P = 0.55). The difference (AM minus DP) in cure rates (95% CI) was -0.5% (-5.1 to 2.0%), which is within the 5% non-inferiority margin. The median fever and parasite clearance times were also similar for AM and DP. The proportion of patients with at least one recorded potential adverse event was significantly higher in the AM group (38 of 87, 44%) than in the DP group (57 of 182, 31%) (relative risk = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.4-0.9; P = 0.04). Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is not inferior to AM in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Laos and is associated with fewer adverse effects. The results of this study were similar to those of the larger multicentre study.",

"Because some febrile patients are unable to swallow or retain oral antipyretic drugs, we carried out a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which intravenous ibuprofen (IV-ibuprofen) was given to adults hospitalized with fever associated with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria treated with oral artesunate plus mefloquine. Thirty patients received IV-ibuprofen 400 mg and 30 received placebo every 6 hours for 72 hours. Reduction in the area above 37.0 degrees C versus time curve was significantly greater for IV-ibuprofen than for placebo during the first 72 hours after first administration. No patients developed severe malaria; parasite clearance was delayed in the patients whose fevers were controlled by IV-ibuprofen (median 37.3 hours versus 23.7 hours in the placebo group [P = 0.0024]). This difference did not appear to be clinically important Adverse events, none considered severe, occurred equally in both groups. IV-ibuprofen was effective and well tolerated in reducing fever in febrile inpatients with malaria.",

"Both migraine and breast cancer are hormonally mediated diseases, and it is biologically plausible that women with a history of migraine may have a reduced breast cancer risk. However, this relationship has only been assessed in a single relatively small study that was unable to assess the effect of migraine triggers, which are also well-established breast cancer risk factors (e.g., use of alcohol and exogenous hormones), on the inverse association observed. Utilizing data on 4,568 breast cancer cases and 4,678 controls who participated in a multicenter population-based case-control study in the United States, we evaluated the association between migraine history and breast cancer risk using unconditional logistic regression. Migraine history data were obtained from structured in-person interviews. Women with a history of migraine had a reduced risk of breast cancer [odds ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-0.82]. This risk did not differ by menopausal status, age at migraine diagnosis, use of prescription migraine medications, or when analyses were restricted to women who avoided various migraine triggers (including alcohol, exogenous hormones, and smoking). These data support a previous finding that a history of migraine may be associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. It extends the prior report in observing that this relationship holds for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women and is independent of exposure to common migraine triggers.",

"Mean age at diagnosis of pheo was 39.5 years (range 14-68 years) in MEN 2A and 32.4 years (range 15-41 years) in MEN 2B patients. Pheo occurred first in 25.1% of the cases (2-15 years before diagnosis of MTC) and after MTC in 40.2% (2-11 years). In other cases (34.7%), MTC and pheo were diagnosed at the same time. Involvement was bilateral in 67.8% of cases. Malignancy was only 4%. Thirty-nine deaths occurred in these 300 patients, 64.1% were linked in pheo, 23.1% to MTC and 12.8% to other causes. Surgery was unilateral in 39.7% of the cases and bilateral adrenalectomy was the first procedure in 48.4%. A bilateral adrenalectomy in two steps had to be done in 11.9% of cases. In conclusion, these results justify systematic and prolonged biochemical screening of pheo during follow-up of MTC and address some questions about the best mode of surgery.",

"Although vitamin D deficiency is a common feature among patients presenting with active tuberculosis, the full scope of vitamin D action during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is poorly understood. As macrophages are the primary site of Mtb infection and are sites of vitamin D signaling, we have used these cells to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying modulation of the immune response by the hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D). We found that the virulent Mtb strain H37Rv elicits a broad host transcriptional response. Transcriptome profiling also revealed that the profile of target genes regulated by 1,25D is substantially altered by infection, and that 1,25D generally boosts infection-stimulated cytokine/chemokine responses. We further focused on the role of 1,25D- and infection-induced interleukin 1Î² (IL-1Î²) expression in response to infection. 1,25D enhanced IL-1Î² expression via a direct transcriptional mechanism. Secretion of IL-1Î² from infected cells required the NLRP3/caspase-1 inflammasome. The impact of IL-1Î² production was investigated in a novel model wherein infected macrophages were co-cultured with primary human small airway epithelial cells. Co-culture significantly prolonged survival of infected macrophages, and 1,25D/infection-induced IL-1Î² secretion from macrophages reduced mycobacterial burden by stimulating the anti-mycobacterial capacity of co-cultured lung epithelial cells. These effects were independent of 1,25D-stimulated autophagy in macrophages but dependent upon epithelial IL1R1 signaling and IL-1Î²-driven epithelial production of the antimicrobial peptide DEFB4/HBD2. These data provide evidence that the anti-microbial actions of vitamin D extend beyond the macrophage by modulating paracrine signaling, reinforcing its role in innate immune regulation in humans.",

"Among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the risk of thromboembolism is a significant concern. However, the reported use of warfarin among patients with AF at elevated risk of stroke remains low. In the present study, we have provided information on anticoagulation use reported during the recent Atrial Fibrillation: Focus on Effective Clinical Treatment Strategies (AFFECTS) Registry. Among patients identified by their physician at baseline to be at an increased risk of stroke, as determined from an assessment of the medical history, 74% received warfarin and 29% received aspirin. Post hoc analysis of warfarin use stratified by Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age, Diabetes, Stroke, (CHADS(2)) doubled score revealed that at the end of the study, warfarin use was 73% (155 of 213) and 66% (185 of 280) in the rate- and rhythm-control patients with a score of > or = 2, respectively, compared to 60% (183 of 306) and 49% (322 of 662) in the rate- and rhythm-control patients with a score of <2, respectively. The practicing cardiologists who participated in this registry initiated anticoagulation therapy in most of their patients with AF. However, warfarin use is not yet in line with the guidelines and evidence-based recommendations. Patients considered at no risk of stroke appear to have been overprescribed anticoagulant agents, and a considerable portion of high-risk patients did not receive warfarin. In conclusion, these results suggest that continued physician education of appropriate anticoagulation use in patients with AF is needed.",

"A prospective comparison was made of the clinical courses of two groups of neonates ventilated according to different protocols: one group at rates of 20 to 40/minute with a one-second IT, and the other at a rate of 60/minute and 0.5 second IT. Other ventilator settings were adjusted within protocol limits to maintain desired blood gas values. Mean starting and highest PIP were lower in the rapid rate group. The results showed no difference in mortality, failure to remain within protocol limits, time requiring respiratory treatment or FiO2 more than 0.6, and incidence of PDA or chronic lung disease. There was a difference (P = 0.011) in number of infants developing pneumothoraces (14% in the rapid group vs 35% in the slow group). Rapid rate ventilation can be used to decrease the incidence of pneumothorax, reserving long IT and higher PIP for infants who cannot be oxygenated or ventilated without them.",

"A Phase 1 dose escalating study was conducted in malaria naÃ¯ve adults to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of the blood stage malaria vaccine BSAM2/AlhydrogelÂ®+ CPG 7909. BSAM2 is a combination of the FVO and 3D7 alleles of recombinant AMA1 and MSP1(42), with equal amounts by weight of each of the four proteins mixed, bound to AlhydrogelÂ®, and administered with the adjuvant CPG 7909. Thirty (30) volunteers were enrolled in two dose groups, with 15 volunteers receiving up to three doses of 40 Âµg total protein at Days 0, 56, and 180, and 15 volunteers receiving up to three doses of 160 Âµg protein on the same schedule. Most related adverse events were mild or moderate, but 4 volunteers experienced severe systemic reactions and two were withdrawn from vaccinations due to adverse events. Geometric mean antibody levels after two vaccinations with the high dose formulation were 136 Âµg/ml for AMA1 and 78 Âµg/ml for MSP1(42). Antibody responses were not significantly different in the high dose versus low dose groups and did not further increase after third vaccination. In vitro growth inhibition was demonstrated and was closely correlated with anti-AMA1 antibody responses. A Phase 1b trial in malaria-exposed adults is being conducted.",

"During atrial fibrillation (AF), multiple wandering propagation wavelets at high rates drift around both atria under controversial hierarchical models. Antiarrhythmic drugs modify the cardiac ionic currents supporting the fibrillation process within the atria, and can alter AF propagation dynamics and even terminate the arrhythmia. However, some other drugs, theoretically nonantiarrhythmic, may slightly block particular cardiac ionic currents through uncertain mechanisms in such a subtle way at regular heart rates that may have been pharmacologically overlooked. These potential effects might be better exposed at much higher activation rates as in AF, where atrial cells depolarize over 400 times per second. In this review, we aimed to compile and discuss results from several studies evaluating the net effect of profound sedation with propofol on atrial cells and atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Propofol is a very commonly used anesthetic agent, and its possible effect on AF dynamics has systematically not been taken into account in the myriad of clinical studies dealing with AF intracardiac recordings. The possible effect of sedation with propofol on AF was evaluated through the analysis of AF propagation patterns before and after its infusion in a series of patients submitted to pulmonary vein ablation. Effect on AV conduction will be discussed as well.",

"To improve the treatment of hepatotoxic responses to antituberculosis polychemotherapy, the impact of remaxol on the biochemical indices and parameters of the antioxidant system in patients with tuberculosis and HIV infection was estimated. The use of remaxol having cytoprotective, anticholestatic, antihypoxitic and antioxidant effects in the treatment of patients with tuberculosis and HIV infection and liver drug damage due to tuberculosis polychemotherapy significantly improved the biochemical indices and lowered the level of the cytolytic and cholestatic syndromes. Remaxol increased the antioxidant system potential and had an antihypoxitic effect.",
"In our data, the association between migraine and cardiovascular disease varies by migraine frequency. Significant associations were only found among women with migraine with aura. Ischemic stroke was the only outcome associated with a high-attack frequency while a low-attack frequency was associated with any vascular event.

"One hundred and twenty children with acute uncomplicated malaria who were managed at the children's outpatient department of the Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesa (a unit of Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals' Complex, Ile-Ife, Osun state, Nigeria) were recruited into the study to determine the effects of lime juice on malaria parasite clearance. These children were randomized into treatment with World Health Organization recommended antimalarials (artemisinin combination therapy, ACT) either alone or with lime juice. Nine of them were lost to follow-up, four were in the group that were managed with ACT and lime, and five in the group that were managed on ACT alone. The average (SD) time to achieve >75% reduction in parasite load was significantly lower in patients on ACT and lime; 30.5âÂ±â2.4âh against 38.6âÂ±â3.3âh for those on ACT alone (pâ<â0.001). Also, while a significantly higher proportion of children on antimalarial drugs and lime juice achieved complete parasite clearance by 72âh of therapy (pâ=â0.007), ten (18.2%) patients without lime had early treatment failure (pâ=â0.003). There were no side effects with the use of lime juice. It may therefore be inferred, from this preliminary work, that lime juice when used with the appropriate antimalarial may enhance malaria parasite clearance especially in those with uncomplicated malaria.",

"Safe, effective concomitant treatment regimens for tuberculosis (TB) and HIV infection are urgently needed. Bedaquiline (BDQ) is a promising new anti-TB drug, and efavirenz (EFV) is a commonly used antiretroviral. Due to EFV's induction of cytochrome P450 3A4, the metabolic enzyme responsible for BDQ biotransformation, the drugs are expected to interact. Based on data from a phase I, single-dose pharmacokinetic study, a nonlinear mixed-effects model characterizing BDQ pharmacokinetics and interaction with multiple-dose EFV was developed. BDQ pharmacokinetics were best described by a 3-compartment disposition model with absorption through a dynamic transit compartment model. Metabolites M2 and M3 were described by 2-compartment models with clearance of BDQ and M2, respectively, as input. Impact of induction was described as an instantaneous change in clearance 1 week after initialization of EFV treatment and estimated for all compounds. The model predicts average steady-state concentrations of BDQ and M2 to be reduced by 52% (relative standard error [RSE], 3.7%) with chronic coadministration. A range of models with alternative structural assumptions regarding onset of induction effect and fraction metabolized resulted in similar estimates of the typical reduction and did not offer a markedly better fit to data. Simulations to investigate alternative regimens mitigating the estimated interaction effect were performed. The results suggest that simple adjustments of the standard regimen during EFV coadministration can prevent reduced exposure to BDQ without increasing exposures to M2. However, exposure to M3 would increase. Evaluation in clinical trials of adjusted regimens is necessary to ensure appropriate dosing for HIV-infected TB patients on an EFV-based regimen.",

"Hypoxia is a major factor in delayed wound healing. The aim of this prospective, randomized, clinical trial was to compare outcomes of treatment in persons with chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) randomly assigned to transdermal continuous oxygen therapy (TCOT) for 4 weeks as an adjunct to standard care (debridement, offloading, and moisture). Nine patients (age 58.6Â±7.1, range 38-73 years) received TCOT (treatment group) and eight patients (age 59.9Â±12.6, range 35-76 years) received standard care alone (control group). Most patients (12) were male, and all had a Wagner I or II foot ulcer for an average of 14 (control group) or 20 months (treatment group). Weekly wound measurements and wound tissue biopsies were obtained and wound fluid collected. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases in wound fluid samples were analyzed using Luminex-based multiplex assays. Tissue-resident macrophages were quantified by immunohistochemistry. At week 4, average wound size reduction was 87% (range 55.7% to 100%) in the treatment group compared to 46% (15% to 99%) in the control group (P <0.05). Changes in cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-8) and proteinases (MMP-1,-2,-9, TIMP-1) at weeks 2 to 4 in wound fluid correlated with clinical findings. CD68+ macrophage counts showed statistically significant reduction in response to TCOT compared to the control group (P <0.01). The results of this study show that TCOT may facilitate healing of DFUs by reversing the inflammatory process through reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and tissue-degrading proteases. Additional research to elucidate the effects of this treatment on complete healing and increase understanding about the role of wound fluid analysis is needed.",

STEMI patients age 75 years or older undergoing primary angioplasty will be extensively studied during admission in 4 tertiary care Hospitals in Spain, assessing their baseline functional status (Barthel index, Lawton-Brody index), frailty (Fried criteria, FRAIL scale [fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight]), comorbidities (Charlson index), nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form), and quality of life (Seattle Angina Questionnaire). Participants will be managed according current recommendations. The primary outcome will be the description of 1-year mortality, its causes, and associated factors. Secondary outcomes will be functional capacity and quality of life. Results will help to better understand the impact of frailty and functional ability on outcomes in elderly STEMI patients undergoing primary angioplasty, thus potentially contributing to improving their clinical management. Higher life expectancy has resulted in a large segment of elderly population and an increase in myocardial infarction in these patients. This calls attention to healthcare systems to focus on promoting methods to improve the clinical management of this population.",

"This objective of this study was to determine benefit of one month combined supplementation (zinc, vitamin A, fish oil) along with anti-tuberculosis drugs (ATD) on increasing serum leptin levels and decreasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in children with tuberculosis (TB). A quasi experimental study was conducted on 22 children (aged 5-14 years) with a positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear. The children were divided into 2 groups. A history, physical examination, anthropometric measurements, serum leptin levels, TNF-alpha levels, retinol and zinc levels were examined in all subjects before and after treatment. Nutritional supplementation and ATD were given to group I while ATD only were given to group II. The change in leptin, TNF-alpha, retinol and zinc levels were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test, while a t-test was used to determine changes in body mass index (BMI). Group I had a higher significant increase in serum leptin levels than group II (p=0.034). Group I had a significantly greater decrease in TNF-a levels than group II (p=0.032). No significant differences in retinol or zinc levels were seen between the two, but both groups had an increase after treatment. Both groups had a significant increase in BMI (p=<0.001) post-treatment compared to pre-treatment. Supplementation with zinc, vitamin A and fish oil is associated with a significant increase in leptin levels and a significant decrease in TNF-alpha levels among children treated for TB. No significant benefit was seen in BMI among children receiving supplementation compared to those without it, although ATD resulted in a significant increase in BMI in both groups.",

"The aim of this study was to prepare fast-disintegrating tablets (FDTs) of diclofenac potassium with sufficient integrity as well as a pleasant taste, using two different fillers and binders: Tablettose 70(Â®) and Di-Pac(Â®). Tablets were made with direct compression method. Tablet properties such as porosity, hardness, and disintegration time were determined. Diclofenac potassium determinations were carried out using a validated spectrophotometric method for the analysis of drug. Furthermore, in vivo experiments were carried out to compare the analgesic effect and the time to relieve migraine headache between the commercial tablets and FDTs of diclofenac potassium against placebo. Results showed that FDTs of diclofenac potassium with durable structure and desirable taste can be prepared using both fillers and binders but tablets prepared with Di-Pac had a better taste so the tablet formulation containing Di-Pac was chosen for in vivo experiments. Placebo controlled in vivo trial demonstrated that 50 mg diclofenac potassium, administered as a single dose of FDTs or commercial tablets, was effective in relieving the pain and both of them were superior to placebo.",

"In many high-risk populations, access to tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment is limited and pockets of high prevalence persist. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of an extensive active case finding program in areas of Cambodia where TB notifications and household poverty rates are highest and access to care is restricted. Thirty operational health districts with high TB incidence and household poverty were randomized into intervention and control groups. In intervention operational health districts, all household and symptomatic neighborhood contacts of registered TB patients of the past two years were encouraged to attend screening at mobile centers. In control districts, routine passive case finding activities continued. The program screened more than 35,000 household and neighborhood contacts and identified 810 bacteriologically confirmed cases. The cost-effectiveness analysis estimated that in these cases the reduction in mortality from 14% to 2% would result in a cost per daily adjusted life year averted of $330, suggesting that active case finding was highly cost-effective.",

"Spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) is a disabling condition mostly affecting young, thin and otherwise healthy males. It is usually caused by ruptured pleural blebs. The first treatment is the insertion of a chest tube (ICT) but in a great number of patients there is recurrence of the disease. We believe that the video assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) is the best treatment possible because it allows us to treat the ruptured bleb radically avoiding any recurrence. In order to prove it, 40 patients admitted in a five-year period, with a SP, were randomly assigned to be treated by ICT or VATS. The ICT patients were in the hospital a mean time of 7.5 (4 to 15) days and the VATS patients, 5.3 (2 to 7) days (P < .05). ICT patients required analgesic drugs during 76.8 +/- 31 hours and VATS patients 38.4 +/- 13 hours (p < .05). From the ICT group, 8 (53%) patients had recurrence of the disease and 6 (40%) had a prolonged air leak, while none of the patients of the VATS group had any complication (< .001). Cost of ICT and VATS were $ 850 and $ 1730, respectively. According to these results, VATS should be the treatment of choice in SP patients. It treats the cause of the disease. It also reduces the hospitalization time, the use of analgesic drugs post surgery, decreases recurrence of the disease and the cost of the treatment. Moreover, the patients were back to work in less than 10 days.",

"To compare the short-term effectiveness and ocular side-effects of fixed combinations of dorzolamide/timolol (DTFC) and brimonidine/timolol (BTFC) in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Forty-two eyes of 42 patients newly diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma were assessed prospectively. One of the two eyes was chosen randomly and treated with DTFC (2Â ÃÂ 1) for 4Â weeks. The treatment was then stopped to allow a 4-week wash-out period. Following the wash-out period, the same eye was treated with BTFC (2Â ÃÂ 1) for 4Â weeks. Intraocular pressure (IOP) values were measured before and after each treatment at 0800, 1,200 and 1,600Â h. Tear function test results and ocular side-effects were also recorded. The mean baseline IOP values for DTFC and BTFC were 24.1Â Â±Â 1.8 and 24.6Â Â±Â 2.4Â mmHg, respectively. The mean IOP values after 4Â weeks of treatment with DTFC or BTFC were 17.1Â Â±Â 2.9 and 16.9Â Â±Â 2.5Â mmHg, respectively. Both medications reduced IOP values significantly (PÂ =Â 0.0000). The effectiveness of both medications was similar (PÂ =Â 0.7363). Both combinations significantly reduced the amount of tear secretion and tear break-up time (PÂ =Â 0.0000). Eye burning was more common with DTFC than with BTFC (PÂ =Â 0.0182). Other adverse effects were observed at similar rates for both combinations. This study demonstrated that the IOP-reducing effects of DTFC and BTFC in patients with POAG are similar. The side-effect profile of BTFC is similar to that of DTFC. Lower occurrence of a burning sensation may improve patient compliance in the BTFC group.",

"In previous analyses of primary efficacy data from two randomized clinical trials, standard dosing regimens of the dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination (COSOPT) and latanoprost (XALATAN) were shown to have equivalent efficacy with regard to reduction in mean daytime diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP). We performed additional post hoc analyses of pooled data from these studies to compare further the efficacy of the two treatments. The studies used identical 3-month, parallel group, randomized, observer-masked and patient-masked, multicenter designs. Patients with a baseline IOP > or = 24 mm Hg were randomized to either the 2% dorzolamide/0.5% timolol combination eye drops twice daily (n = 273) or 0.005% latanoprost eye drops once daily (n = 271). The IOP measurements were made at 8 AM, 10 AM, 2 PM, and 4 PM at the baseline visit and then on each of the 3 monthly assessment days. The following measures were analyzed on a post hoc basis: 1) percentages of patients meeting target levels of IOP reduction; 2) mean IOP reduction in those patients with high IOP (> or =30 mmHg) at baseline; 3) mean IOP at each of the assessment time points during a day. A total of 259 patients in the dorzolamide/timolol group and 268 patients in the latanoprost group were included in the efficacy analysis. At 3 months, both treatments showed similar efficacy with regard to the percentages of patients who achieved target levels of IOP reduction (e.g., 40% IOP reduction in 15% of dorzolamide/timolol combination patients and 13% of latanoprost patients), mean IOP reduction in those patients with high IOP at baseline (dorzolamide/ timolol combination, 12.5 mmHg, latanoprost, 12.6 mmHg), and mean IOP at each time point during the day. By the measures used in this analysis, the dorzolamide/timolol combination and latanoprost were equally effective at lowering IOP in patients with ocular hypertension or glaucoma.",
"The objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy and safety of frovatriptan, and rizatriptan in the subgroup of women with menstrually related migraine of a multicenter, randomized, double blind, cross-over study. Each patient received frovatriptan 2.5Â mg or rizatriptan 10Â mg in a randomized sequence: after treating 3 episodes of migraine in not more than 3Â months with the first treatment, the patient had to switch to the other treatment. Menstrually related migraine was defined according to the criteria listed in the Appendix of the last IHS Classification of Headache disorders. 99 out of the 125 patients included in the intention-to-treat analysis of the main study were of a female gender: 93 had regular menstrual cycles and were, thus, included in this analysis. A total of 49 attacks classified as menstrually related migraine were treated with frovatriptan and 59 with rizatriptan. Rate of pain relief at 2Â h was 58% for frovatriptan and 64% for rizatriptan (pÂ =Â NS), while rate of pain free at 2Â h was 31 and 34% (pÂ =Â NS), respectively. At 24Â h, 67 and 81% of frovatriptan-treated, and 61 and 74% of rizatriptan-treated patients were pain free and had pain relief, respectively (pÂ =Â NS). Recurrence at 24Â h was significantly (pÂ <Â 0.01) lower with frovatriptan (10 vs. 32% rizatriptan). Frovatriptan was as effective as rizatriptan in the immediate treatment of menstrually related migraine attacks while showing a favorable sustained effect with a lower rate of migraine recurrence. These results need to be confirmed by randomized, double-blind, prospective, large clinical trials.",

"We performed a descriptive analysis of acute and potentially life-threatening tropical diseases among 82,825 ill western travelers reported to GeoSentinel from June of 1996 to August of 2011. We identified 3,655 patients (4.4%) with a total of 3,666 diagnoses representing 13 diseases, including falciparum malaria (76.9%), enteric fever (18.1%), and leptospirosis (2.4%). Ninety-one percent of the patients had fever; the median time from travel to presentation was 16 days. Thirteen (0.4%) patients died: 10 with falciparum malaria, 2 with melioidosis, and 1 with severe dengue. Falciparum malaria was mainly acquired in West Africa, and enteric fever was largely contracted on the Indian subcontinent; leptospirosis, scrub typhus, and murine typhus were principally acquired in Southeast Asia. Western physicians seeing febrile and recently returned travelers from the tropics need to consider a wide profile of potentially life-threatening tropical illnesses, with a specific focus on the most likely diseases described in our large case series.",
"Sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients are at high risk of developing malaria which is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in this disease. In Senegal, malaria transmission is high during rainy season, between July and October, and it was noted that sickle-cell crisis are frequent during this period. Then we carried out a double-blind randomized controlled trial to compare the impact of monthly sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) during the high-transmission season versus placebo on malaria incidence and morbidity of sickle-cell anemia. Sixty (60) SCD patients were randomized either to receive three intermittent preventive treatment (ITP) with SP or placebo using the random permutation table with nine elements. The drug was administrated as follows: sulfadoxine 25 mg/kg and pyrimethamine 1.25 mg/kg and this treatment was given once during the following months: September, October, and November. Overall four episodes of malaria disease were diagnosed, all these cases in the placebo arm. Thus, overall prevalence was 6.6% and there was no other case of malaria in the SP arm during the study period. Parasitological diagnosis confirmed the presence of Plasmodium falciparum in all four cases. No patient death was encountered during the study. SP treatment was well tolerated as only one patient (1.6%) in the SP arm reported pruritus. A significant reduction of patients' complaints (p = 002) and blood requirements (p = 0.001) was noted in the SP group; whereas, no impact was observed on vaso-occlusive crisis and hospitalization occurrence. Malaria prophylaxis by monthly intake of SP during the transmission period of the parasite reduced the prevalence of malaria and was safe in SCD patients leaving in malaria endemic area.",

"Diagnosing pleural tuberculosis (plTB) might be difficult due to limited sensitivity of conventional microbiology tools. As M. tuberculosis (MTB)-specific T cells are recruited into pleural space in plTB, their detection may provide useful clinical information. To this aim, in addition to standard diagnostic tests, we used the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT) test in blood and pleural effusion (PE) samples from 48 patients with clinical suspicion of plTB, 18 (37.5%) of whom had confirmed plTB. Four of them (22.2%) tested positive with a nucleic acid amplification test for MTB. The tuberculin skin test was positive in most confirmed plTB cases (88.9%). Positive QFT-IT tests were significantly more frequent in patients with confirmed plTB, as compared to patients with an alternative diagnosis, both in blood (77.7 vs 36.6%, p=0.006) and in PE samples (83.3% vs 46.6%, p=0.02). In addition, both blood and PE MTB-stimulated IFN-gamma levels were significantly higher in plTB patients (p=0.03 and p=0.0049 vs non-plTB, respectively). In blood samples, QFT-IT had 77.8% sensitivity and 63.3% specificity, resulting in 56.0% positive (PPV) and 82.6% negative (NPV) predictive values. On PE, QFT-IT sensitivity was 83.3% and specificity 53.3% (PPV 51.7% and NPV 84.2%). The optimal AUC-derived cut-off for MTB-stimulated pleural IFN-gamma level was 3.01 IU/mL (77.8% sensitivity, 80% specificity, PPV 68.4% and NPV 82.8%). These data suggest that QFT-IT might have a role in ruling out plTB in clinical practice.",
"Pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) are neuroendocrine tumours, originating from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. They are either sporadic or hereditary. It is important to identify the hereditary cases, so that patients and relatives with germline mutations can be offered regular surveillance. The objective of this study was the detection of pathogenic germline mutations in a cohort of Norwegian PHEO patients. Blood samples and/or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens, were collected from 60 patients who were operated upon between 1986 and 2004 at two university hospitals in Norway. DNA mutation analyses were performed successfully in the 42 blood samples and in one of the paraffin-embedded tissue specimen in VHL, RET, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD and NF1. In all, 32 different DNA variants were observed, of which 8 were classified as pathogenic (19 %), or possibly pathogenic; three in NF1, two in RET and VHL and one in SDHB. Two variants were observed in one patient, one in SDHB and one in NF1. Three of these variants are, to the best of our knowledge, new ones; two in NF1 [c.950_51insGCTGA, (p.Glu318LeufsX59) and c.1588G > A, (p.Val530Ile)] and one in VHL (c.308C > T, p.Pro103Leu). In conclusion the overall incidence of germline mutations in genes associated with familial PHEO was found to be of the same order of magnitude in the present Norwegian series as in those from other countries. Two new NF1 variants and one new VHL gene variant were detected.",

"Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) improves glycemic control within days after surgery, and changes in insulin sensitivity and Î²-cell function are likely to be involved. We studied 10 obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 10 obese glucose-tolerant subjects before and 1 week, 3 months, and 1 year after RYGB. Participants were included after a preoperative diet-induced total weight loss of -9.2 Â± 1.2%. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity were assessed using the hyperinsulinemic- euglycemic clamp combined with the glucose tracer technique, and Î²-cell function was evaluated in response to an intravenous glucose-glucagon challenge as well as an oral glucose load. Within 1 week, RYGB reduced basal glucose production, improved basal hepatic insulin sensitivity, and increased insulin clearance, highlighting the liver as an important organ responsible for early effects on glucose metabolism after surgery. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal and suppression of fatty acids did not improve immediately after surgery but increased at 3 months and 1 year; this increase likely was related to the reduction in body weight. Insulin secretion increased after RYGB only in patients with T2D and only in response to oral glucose, underscoring the importance of the changed gut anatomy.",
"The aim of this trial is to determine whether a 5 minute systemic injection of sodium nitrite, administered immediately before opening of the infarct related artery, results in significant reduction of IRI in patients with first acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI). The primary clinical end point is the difference in infarct size between sodium nitrite and placebo groups measured using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) performed at 6-8 days following the AMI and corrected for area at risk (AAR) using the endocardial surface area technique. Secondary end points include (i) plasma creatine kinase and Troponin I measured in blood samples taken pre-injection of the study medication and over the following 72 hours; (ii) infarct size at six months; (iii) Infarct size corrected for AAR measured at 6-8 days using T2 weighted triple inversion recovery (T2-W SPAIR or STIR) CMR imaging; (iv) Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction measured by CMR at 6-8 days and six months following injection of the study medication; and (v) LV end systolic volume index at 6-8 days and six months.

"Undernutrition is common among smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB+) patients. Micronutrient supplementation may improve treatment outcomes, but it is unclear whether additional energy-protein would be beneficial. The present study aimed to assess the effect of energy-protein supplementation on weight, body composition and handgrip strength against a background of high micronutrient intake during tuberculosis (TB) treatment. A total of 377 PTB+ patients co-infected with HIV were randomly allocated one or six biscuits daily for 60Â d during TB treatment. Weight, arm fat area, arm muscle area and handgrip strength were assessed at baseline and 2 and 5 months. There were no effects on any outcome at 2 months, but energy-protein supplementation was associated with a 1Â·3 (95Â % CI -Â 0Â·1, 2Â·8)Â kg marginally significant gain in handgrip strength at 5 months. However, after 2 months, energy-protein supplementation led to a weight gain of 1Â·9 (95Â % CI 0Â·1, 3Â·7)Â kg among patients with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) counts â¥Â 350Â cells/Î¼l, but not among patients with low CD4 counts (Â -Â 0Â·2Â kg; 95Â % CI -Â 1Â·3, 0Â·8, PinteractionÂ =Â 0Â·03). Similarly, at 5 months, energy-protein supplementation led to a 2Â·3 (95Â % CI 0Â·6, 4Â·1)Â kg higher handgrip strength gain among patients with CD4 counts <Â 350Â cells/Î¼l, but not in those with high CD4 counts (PinteractionÂ =Â 0Â·04). In conclusion, energy-protein supplementation to PTB+ HIV-co-infected patients had no overall effects on weight and body composition, but was associated with marginally significant gain in handgrip strength. More research is needed to develop an effective supplement, before it is recommended to TB programmes.",

"Both insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) reduce malaria in high malaria transmission areas. The combined effect of these interventions is unknown. We conducted a non-randomized prospective cohort study to determine protective efficacy of IRS with ITNs (ITN + IRS) compared with ITNs alone (ITN only) in preventing Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia. At baseline, participants provided blood samples for malaria smears, were presumptively treated for malaria, and received ITNs. Blood smears were made monthly and at sick visits. In total, 1,804 participants were enrolled. Incidence of P. falciparum parasitemia in the ITN + IRS and ITN only groups was 18 and 44 infections per 100 persons-years at risk, respectively (unadjusted rate ratio = 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.31-0.56). Adjusted protective efficacy of ITN + IRS compared with ITN only was 62% (95% CI = 0.50-0.72). The combination of IRS and ITN might be a feasible strategy to further reduce malaria transmission in areas of persistent perennial malaria transmission.",

"To evaluate the rate of and risk factors for hepatotoxicity in tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) co-infected patients while receiving non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) and a rifampicin (RMP)-containing anti-TB regimen. We analyzed data from the N2R study which was an open label, randomized, comparative trial comparing treatment outcomes between 71 TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients receiving efavirenz (EFV)-based and nevirapine (NVP)-based ART; all of whom were receiving RMP-containing anti-TB treatment. Demographic data, liver function test, CD4 cell count, plasma HIV-1 RNA, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were collected before initiating ART (week 0). Liver enzymes and total bilirubin levels were monitored at 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks after ART initiation. All patients were followed until TB therapy was completed. Of 142 patients, 8 patients were excluded. Among the remaining 134 patients, the mean+/-SD age was 36.8+/-8.6 years and 67.2% were male. Severe hepatotoxicity (grade 3 or 4) developed in 4 patients (2.9%); 3 patients (4.6%) in the NVP group and 1 patient (1.4%) in the EFV group. Severe hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 7 patients (5.2%); 5 patients (7.7%) in the NVP group and 2 patients (2.9%) in the EFV group. Grade 1 or 2 hepatotoxicity occurred in 34 patients (31.4%). Hepatitis C virus co-infection (adjusted OR 3.03; 95%CI 1.26-7.29) was an independent risk factor associated with grade 1-4 hepatotoxicity (p=0.013). Monitoring of hepatotoxicity should be considered in TB/HIV-1 co-infected patients who are infected with HCV and receiving NVP.",

"In-hospital infection (IHI) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has received little attention, although it may have a significant effect on outcomes and costs because of prolonged hospital stay. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the incidence, type, predictors, and prognostic effects of IHI after TAVI. This study included 298 consecutive patients from 2 centers who underwent TAVI from November 2005 to November 2011. IHI during the hospital stay was defined on the basis of symptoms and signs assessed by the attending physician in the cardiac care unit or medium care unit in combination with all technical examinations performed to confirm infection. IHI after TAVI was observed in 58 patients (19.5%): urinary tract infections in 25 patients (43.1%), pneumonia in 12 patients (20.7%), and access-site infections in 7 patients (12.1%). In 12 patients (20.7%), the site of infection could not be determined, and 2 patients (3.4%) had multiple infection sites. Multivariate analysis revealed that surgical access through the femoral artery was the most important determinant of infection (odds ratio [OR] 4.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 17.19), followed by perioperative major stroke (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 9.52) and overweight (body mass index â¥25 kg/mÂ²; OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.12 to 4.59). The length of hospital stay in patients with IHIs was 15.0 days (interquartile range 8.0 to 22.0) compared with 7.0 days (interquartile range 4.0 to 10.0) in patients without infections (p <0.0001). Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival at 1 year were 76.6% and 74.4% (log-rank, p = 0.61), respectively. Unadjusted and adjusted OR analysis revealed that IHI did not predict mortality at 30 days (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.30) or at 1 year (hazard ratio 1.24, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.25). In conclusion, IHI occurred in 19.5% of the patients. Patient-related and, more important, procedure-related variables play a role in the occurrence of infection, indicating that improvements in the execution of TAVI may lead to a reduction of this complication.",

"Th1 lymphocytes are crucial in the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Nevertheless, IFN-Î³ alone is not sufficient in the complete eradication of the bacteria, suggesting that other cytokines might be required for pathogen removal. Th17 cells have been associated with M. tuberculosis infection, but the role of IL-17-producing cells in human TB remains to be understood. Therefore, we investigated the induction and regulation of IFN-Î³ and IL-17 during the active disease. TB patients were classified as High and Low Responder individuals according to their T cell responses against the antigen, and cytokine expression upon M. tuberculosis stimulation was investigated in peripheral blood and pleural fluid. Afterwards, the potential correlation among the proportions of cytokine-producing cells and clinical parameters was analyzed. In TB patients, M. tuberculosis induced IFN-Î³ and IL-17, but in comparison with BCG-vaccinated healthy donors, IFN-Î³ results were reduced significantly, and IL-17 was markedly augmented. Moreover, the main source of IL-17 was represented by CD4(+)IFN-Î³(+)IL-17(+) lymphocytes, a Th1/Th17 subset regulated by IFN-Î³. Interestingly, the ratio of antigen-expanded CD4(+)IFN-Î³(+)IL-17(+) lymphocytes, in peripheral blood and pleural fluid from TB patients, was correlated directly with clinical parameters associated with disease severity. Indeed, the highest proportion of CD4(+)IFN-Î³(+)IL-17(+) cells was detected in Low Responder TB patients, individuals displaying severe pulmonary lesions, and longest length of disease evolution. Taken together, the present findings suggest that analysis of the expansion of CD4(+)IFN-Î³(+)IL-17(+) T lymphocytes in peripheral blood of TB patients might be used as an indicator of the clinical outcome in active TB.",
"Menstrually related migraine (MRM) is a particularly difficult-to-treat pain condition, associated with substantial disability. Aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of frovatriptan and zolmitriptan in the treatment of MRM attacks, analyzing data from a multicenter, randomized, double blind, cross-over study. We analyzed the subset of 76 regularly menstruating women who participated in one head-to-head multicenter, randomized, double blind, cross-over clinical trial and who took the study drugs to treat MRM attacks. In a randomized sequence, each patient received frovatriptan 2.5Â mg or zolmitriptan 2.5Â mg: after treating three episodes of migraine in no more than 3Â months with the first treatment, the patient had to switch to the other treatment. MRM was defined according to the criteria listed in the Appendix of the last Classification of Headache disorders of the International Headache Society. A total of 73 attacks, classified as MRM, were treated with frovatriptan and 65 with zolmitriptan. Rate of pain relief at 2Â h was 52% for frovatriptan and 53% for zolmitriptan (pÂ =Â NS), while rate of pain free at 2Â h was 22 and 26% (pÂ =Â NS), respectively. At 24Â h, 74 and 83% of frovatriptan-treated and 69 and 82% of zolmitriptan-treated patients were pain free and had pain relief, respectively (pÂ =Â NS). Recurrence at 24Â h was significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) lower with frovatriptan (15 vs. 22% zolmitriptan). Frovatriptan proved to be effective in the immediate treatment of MRM attacks, similarly to zolmitriptan, but showed lower recurrence rates, and thus a better sustained relief.",

The study consisted of 210 patients (87 trauma, 123 medical) requiring a CVC as part of their emergency department care. Catheter placement and complications were determined by immediate chest radiograph, two-day followup, and chart review after discharge. Results demonstrated no statistically significant differences in success rates or complications, with the exception of catheter malfunction due to extrathoracic vascular placement or catheter kinkage. This complication occurred more frequently when the guidewire technique was used. The guidewire CVC technique does not appear to offer any improvement of complication rates when compared to the nonguidewire technique.",

"The objective of the study was to: 1) investigate the performance of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) in HIV-infected patients with active tuberculosis (TB); 2) evaluate the sequential changes in QFT-GIT assay during the treatment response; 3) investigate the direct in vitro effects of antituberculous drugs on both secretion of IFN-g and apoptosis of T cells. Forty-four HIV-patients with active TB were enrolled and tested with QFT-GIT. Thirteen of them were followed longitudinally by QFT-GIT, performed at baseline and six and nine months after TB-treatment onset. For in vitro experiments, cells from healthy donors and HIV-naive subjects were pretreated with four antituberculous-drugs, and then examined for IFN-g secretion and apoptosis of T-cells. The QFT-GIT was positive in 66%, negative in 11.3% and indeterminate in 22.7%. Longitudinal analysis in 13 HIV-TB subjects showed that at therapy completion a reversion to negative response was found only in 38.4% of patients, but in 30.7% the QFT-GIT remained positive. Overall, during the anti-TB treatment no significant decrease in average IFN-g response was observed in these patients (p<0.001). In vitro experiments showed that the four antituberculous- drugs, within the range of therapeutically achievable concentrations, did not exert any down-regulatory effect on IFN-g production and did not have any effect on apoptosis of T cells from HIV naÃ¯ve subjects. Despite the high rate of indeterminate results, QFT-GIT assay may represent a good tool in the diagnostic workup for active TB in HIV-patients. Although the antituberculous drugs do not have any direct effect on host immune response to mycobacterial antigen, changes in longitudinal IGRA response have been found during in vivo anti-TB treatment.",

"Rapid recovery is desirable in pediatric neurosurgical patients to obtain an early neurologic assessment. We compared the recovery characteristics of 2 commonly used anesthetic agents, sevoflurane and isoflurane, under bispectral index-guided anesthesia in children undergoing spinal surgery. Eighty children who underwent surgery for occult spinal dysraphism at the lumbar and sacral level were randomized to anesthesia with sevoflurane or isoflurane in oxygen and nitrous oxide. Anesthesia depth was guided by a bispectral index monitor kept between 40 and 60. In addition to time at emergence, extubation and discharge, recovery (modified Aldrete) score, and hemodynamics were compared. The 2 groups did not differ significantly with respect to demographics, duration of surgery and anesthesia, and intraoperative hemodynamic changes. Extubation (6.4+/-3.3 vs. 10.7+/-4.6) and emergence (7.8+/-3.4 vs. 12.8+/-5.6) times (minutes) were significantly shorter with sevoflurane (P<0.001). Time (minutes) to achieve full Aldrete (modified) scores was less with sevoflurane (13.9+/-5.3 vs. 20.3+/-6.5) than isoflurane (P<0.001). However, the time (minutes) to achieve discharge criteria from postanesthesia care unit (140.7+/-49.3 vs. 146+/-43.3) and first dose of postoperative analgesic (60+/-24.1 vs. 72+/-33.4) in addition to incidence of postoperative agitation were similar in both groups (P>0.05).

"A total of 12 537 participants with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine titrated to a fasting glucose of â¤ 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or standard glycaemic care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose â¤ 54 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose â¤ 36 mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke; (ii) mortality; (iii) CV mortality; and (iv) arrhythmic death. Hazards were estimated before and after adjustment for a hypoglycaemia propensity score. During a median of 6.2 years (IQR: 5.8-6.7), non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 41.7 and 14.4% glargine and standard group participants, respectively, while severe episodes occurred in 5.7 and 1.8%, respectively. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was not associated with any outcome following adjustment. Conversely, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a greater risk for the primary outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.02, P < 0.001), mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.19, P < 0.001), CV death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27-2.30, P < 0.001) and arrhythmic death (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.17-2.67, P = 0.007).

"Incidentally detected adrenal tumors are a common finding during abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Although most of these lesions are benign adenomas, adrenocortical carcinomas and metastases constitute 5% to 10% of all tumors. Adrenal biopsy may be helpful, but its diagnostic value is controversial and disputed, and prospective studies have not yet been performed. Therefore, the diagnostic accuracy of adrenal core biopsy was evaluated in a prospective multicenter study involving 8 surgical centers in Germany and Austria. A total of 220 biopsies from surgical specimens of the adrenal gland were punctured in an ex vivo approach and processed for pathohistologic diagnosis using paraffin sections, routine staining, and immunohistochemistry (keratin KL1, vimentin, S100 protein, chromogranin A, synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase, D11, MiB-1, and p53 protein). The evaluating pathologist was blinded for clinical data from the patients. A total of 89 adrenal adenomas (40.5%), 22 adrenal carcinomas (10.0%), 55 pheochromocytomas (25.0%), 15 metastases (6.8%), 16 adrenal hyperplasias (7.2%), and 23 other tumors (10.5%) were studied. Nine cases were excluded due to incomplete data (n = 2) or insufficient biopsy specimen (n = 7). In the remaining 211 tumors, compared with the final diagnoses of the surgical specimen, bioptic diagnoses were absolutely correct in 76.8% of the cases, nearly correct in 13.2% of the cases, and incorrect in 10% of the cases. Pheochromocytomas were correctly diagnosed in 96% of the cases, cortical adenomas were correctly or nearly correctly reported in 91% of the cases, cortical carcinomas were correctly or nearly correctly reported in 76% of the cases, and metastases were correctly or nearly correctly reported in 77% of the cases. Of the 39 malignant lesions, only 4 were misclassified, 2 as benign and 2 as possibly malignant. This resulted in an overall sensitivity for malignancy of 94.6% and specificity of 95.3%. Our findings suggest that adrenal core biopsy is a useful method for identifying and classifying adrenal tumorous lesions if sufficient biopsy specimens can be obtained. However, in clinical practice it remains to be shown whether the benefits of biopsy outweigh the risks of the procedure.",
"PURPOSE. To examine whether treatment with oral blood-pressure-lowering medication or statins influences the risk of glaucoma. METHODS. This study was a case-control investigation, nested within a computerized primary care database of 177 general practices across the United Kingdom; 8778 cases diagnosed and/or treated for glaucoma between 2000 and 2007, and 8778 glaucoma-free controls matched for age, sex, and practice. Odds ratios for treatment with oral antihypertensives (including selective beta(1) and nonselective beta-blockers) and statins in the 5 years before diagnosis were calculated by logistic regression, adjusted for a marker of socioeconomic position and number of drug types prescribed (as a measure of health service usage). RESULTS. Prevalence of oral beta-blocker use in the 5 years before diagnosis was lower in the cases (22.5%) than in the controls (23.6%), adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80-0.94). This effect was presence with treatment with beta(1)-selective medications (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74-0.88) but not with nonselective medications (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.94-1.24). The prevalence of thiazide use was higher among the glaucoma cases than among the controls (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.23). Neither statins nor other antihypertensive treatments were associated with the risk of glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS. Oral beta(1) beta-blockers may protect against development of glaucoma. The current consensus on the relative importance of beta(2) receptor blockade in treating glaucoma may have to be reviewed. Changes in prescribing oral beta-blockers for cardiovascular disorders may affect the number of those who eventually have glaucoma. There is no evidence to suggest that statins have a preventive role in glaucoma.",
"Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) may develop functional asplenia as a chronic complication, secondary to repeated episodes of polymerisation of haemoglobin S. It is known that increased plasma concentrations of fetal haemoglobin (HbF) reduce the polymerisation of haemoglobin S. Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapeutic agent capable of increasing HbF levels in the red blood cells and its use has recently been proposed in the treatment of SCD. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term therapy with hydroxyurea on recovery of splenic function. Twenty-one patients (aged 3-22 years; 14 with SS haemoglobinopathy, 7 with Sbeta(0) haemoglobinopathy) were studied with liver/spleen scintigraphy before and after 6 and 12 months of treatment. All studies were submitted to visual inspection and semi-quantitative analyses using spleen/liver ratios. Imaging prior to treatment demonstrated functional asplenia in nine SS patients and one Sbeta(0) patient and impaired splenic function in five SS patients and six Sbeta(0) patients. After treatment, splenic function improved in ten patients, remained unchanged in eight and worsened in three. Using liver/spleen imaging, it was possible to demonstrate that hydroxyurea is capable of improving splenic function in some SCD patients. Improvement is not always possible and frequently does not lead to a normal splenic function even after 1 year of treatment.",
"In the setting of acute myocardial ischemia, the hypoperfused portion of the myocardium is in danger of becoming irreversibly injured. This portion is called the area at risk (AAR). It is of clinical interest to be able to estimate the AAR for further evaluation and improvement of different revascularization strategies. The Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease Score (APPROACH-score) has been shown to be a jeopardy score with a good performance for angiographic assessment of the myocardium supplied by a coronary vessel, representing the AAR. Recently, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has been demonstrated to also provide good results in determining the AAR, especially in the setting of acute ST-elevation infarction patients. Therefore, the aim of our trial was to compare T2-weighted CMR imaging for assessment of AAR in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and to validate this approach against the angiographic APPROACH-score. We enrolled sixty-four patients presenting with acute NSTEMI that underwent coronary X-ray angiography within 72 h of symptom onset. Two blinded readers performed offline angiographic AAR assessment using the modified APPROACH-score, as being described elsewhere. Furthermore, with the use of a semi-automatic T2w-CMR approach, the AAR was quantified by two fully blinded readers. The resulting mean AAR determined by the modified APPROACH-score was 28.6 Â± 10.0 %. The mean CMR derived AAR was 27.6 Â± 12.7 %. CMR assessment tended to slightly underestimate the AAR in comparison to angiographic scoring (difference -0.09 Â± 7.6 %). There is a good correlation between the AAR assessed by CMR and by angiography (r = 0.65, p < 0.001). T2-weigthed CMR is able to quantify the AAR with very good correlation to the angiographic APPROACH-score in NSTEMI patients.",
"Among 5059 genotyped patients with acute coronary syndromes, clopidogrel as compared with placebo significantly reduced the rate of the primary efficacy outcome, irrespective of the genetically determined metabolizer phenotype (P=0.12 for heterogeneity). The effect of clopidogrel in reducing the rate of the primary efficacy outcome was similar in patients who were heterozygous or homozygous for loss-of-function alleles and in those who were not carriers of the alleles (rate among carriers, 8.0% with clopidogrel vs. 11.6% with placebo; hazard ratio with clopidogrel, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.98; rate among noncarriers, 9.5% vs. 13.0%; hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.87). In contrast, gain-of-function carriers derived more benefit from clopidogrel treatment as compared with placebo than did noncarriers (rate of primary outcome among carriers, 7.7% vs. 13.0%; hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.73; rate among noncarriers, 10.0% vs. 12.2%; hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.05; P=0.02 for interaction). The effect of clopidogrel on bleeding did not vary according to genotypic subgroups. Among 1156 genotyped patients with atrial fibrillation, there was no evidence of an interaction with respect to either efficacy or bleeding between the study treatment and the metabolizer phenotype, loss-of-function carrier status, or gain-of-function carrier status.",
"Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) decreases polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) and improves outcomes in sickle cell disease (SSD). Therefore, a therapeutic goal in SSD is pharmacologic reactivation of HbF. Silencing of the gamma-globin (HbF) gene is associated with DNA methylation. The cytosine analog 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. We examined if subcutaneous decitabine could increase HbF levels and improve SSD pathophysiology without cytotoxicity. Eight symptomatic SSD patients resistant or intolerant of standard treatment with hydroxyurea received decitabine 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously 1 to 3 times per week in 2 cycles of 6-week duration. Treatment decreased neutrophils and increased mean HbF (6.5% to 20.4%, P <.0001) and mean total hemoglobin (76 to 96 g/L [7.6 to 9.6 g/dL], P <.001). Features of vaso-occlusive crisis pathophysiology such as red cell adhesion, endothelial damage, and coagulation pathway activity significantly improved. gamma-Globin gene promoter methylation decreased, and platelets and the proportion of megakaryocytes and erythroid cells in the marrow increased without a decrease in marrow cellularity, consistent with a DNA hypomethylating, noncytotoxic mechanism of action. Weekly subcutaneous decitabine produces cumulative increases in HbF and total hemoglobin through a noncytotoxic mechanism of action. Chronic dosing and sustained increases in hemoglobin F and total hemoglobin levels may be possible. Further studies in SSD and thalassemia are indicated.",

"Gender is a major determinant of the outcomes of many health interventions. This study documents the order of significant improvements in metabolic parameters of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) having metabolic syndrome within 12 weeks of physical exercise programmes. Twenty-nine patients, mean age 49.6 Â± 3.7 years, presenting with high fasting plasma glucose, high triglycerides, hypertension, and high waist circumference undertook a thrice weekly aerobic and endurance exercise programme in addition to their drugs and diet. Variables were assessed at baseline and end of every two weeks for twelve weeks. Compared with baseline, significant improvement (P < 0.05) in the metabolic parameters occurred in this order for the male participants: fasting glucose (2nd week), triglycerides and waist circumference (4th week), and systolic blood pressure (12th week). For the female participants, it was fasting glucose (4th week), triglycerides (6th week), and waist circumference (10th week). Regardless of the gender, fasting glucose was the first to improve significantly, followed by triglycerides. Hypertension did not improve significantly at all in the female participants as they may require more than twelve weeks of therapeutic exercise for any significant improvement in hypertension.",

"The purpose of this prospective pilot study was to determine the therapeutic effect of continuous testosterone, delivered as a subcutaneous implant, on the severity of migraine headaches in pre- and post-menopausal patients. Twenty-seven women with a history of documented migraine headache were asked to rate their headache severity using a five-point scale at baseline (prior to therapy); and again, 3 months following treatment with testosterone implants. Improvement in headache severity was noted by 92% of patients and the mean level of improvement was statistically significant (3.3 on a 5 point scale). In addition, there was no difference in the level of improvement between pre- and post-menopausal cohorts. Seventy-four percent of patients reported a headache severity score of '0' (none) on testosterone implant therapy for the 3-month treatment period. Continuous testosterone was effective therapy in reducing the severity of migraine headaches in both pre- and post-menopausal women.",

"Vestibular rehabilitation programs do appear to play a beneficial role in the treatment of dizziness in patients with vestibular migraine. Anecdotally, however, patients with vestibular migraine may report persistent significant symptoms at the end of a standard treatment period where other non-migrainous patients are accomplishing their treatment goals. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of vestibular rehabilitation in patients with vestibular migraine compared to patients with vestibular symptoms without migraine. Thirty-six patients (vestibular migraine = 20, vestibular impairment = 16) with significant daily vestibular symptoms received a nine week customized vestibular rehabilitation program. Each subject attended five therapy appointments occurring at initial, two, five, nine and six months. A range of subjective and physical performance outcome measures were taken at baseline, nine weeks and six months. The vestibular migraine group showed poorer subjective performance at the onset of therapy, which was not reflected in the difference in physical performance between the groups. Both groups benefitted equally from rehabilitation. The same degree of improvement was observed in the migraine group regardless of medication regime. This study has validated vestibular rehabilitation as an effective treatment in dizzy patients both with and without vestibular migraine where the use of medication did not preclude benefit from therapy. However, further research is required to clarify the role of specific vestibular suppressant medications and the scheduling of their use in relation to physical therapy.",

"One limitation of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is the size of the available needles, frequently yielding only cells for cytological examination. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of newly developed needle forceps to obtain tissue for the histological diagnosis of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. Patients with enlarged, positron emission tomography (PET)-positive lymph nodes were included. The transbronchial needle forceps (TBNF), a sampling instrument combining the characteristics of a needle (bevelled tip for penetrating through the bronchial wall) with forceps (two serrated jaws for grasping tissue) was used through the working channel of the EBUS-TBNA scope. Efficacy and safety was assessed. 50 patients (36 males and 14 females; mean age 51 yrs) with enlarged or PET-positive lymph nodes were included in this pilot study. In 48 (96%) patients penetration of the bronchial wall was possible and in 45 patients tissue for histological diagnosis was obtained. In three patients TBNF provided inadequate material. For patients in whom the material was adequate for a histological examination, a specific diagnosis was established in 43 (86%) out of 50 patients (nonsmall cell lung cancer: n=24; small cell lung cancer: n=7; sarcoidosis: n=4; Hodgkin's lymphoma: n=4; tuberculosis: n=2; and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: n=2).No clinically significant procedure-related complications were encountered.

"Vascular endothelial growth factor-B (VEGF-B is an important member of the VEGF protein family. Recent animal studies indicated that VEGF-B signaling had determinant roles in insulin resistance, lipid distribution and metabolism in type 2 diabetes. The clinical significance of VEGF-B in type 2 diabetes is still not clear. This study aimed to correlate VEGF-B levels with biochemistry characteristics and target organ damage in type 2 diabetic patients. Serum VEGF-B levels were measured using ELISA. A crosssectional control study, which included 180 type 2 diabetic patients and 62 healthy subjects, was carried out. Diabetic patients who were undergoing insulin therapy were not included. This results showed that serum VEGF-B levels did not differ between the type 2 diabetic patients and the healthy controls (169.2&#x2213;118.8 vs 163.5&#x2213;115.2 pg/mL; P=0.734). VEGF-B levels in type 2 diabetic patients were significantly associated with the levels of c-peptide, total cholesterol and triglyceride. T-test analysis showed that the associations of serum VEGF-B levels with insulin resistance, pancreatic reserve, HDL and LDL were not significant. Regression analysis showed that VEGF-B levels were significantly correlated with diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy. No significant association between VEGF-B and macro-vasculopathy was found. In conclusion, our study findings suggested that VEGF-B levels did not differ between the type 2 diabetic patients and the normal controls. High VEGF-B levels might correlate with the presence of hyperlipidemia and target organ damage in type 2 diabetic patients.",

"The aim of this study was to compare the recovery cycle of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in children with migraine without aura before and after treatment with topiramate. Eleven migraine children were studied before and after a 3-month treatment with topiramate at the average dose of 1.3 mg/kg/day. We calculated the SEP latency and amplitude modifications after paired electrical stimuli at 5, 20 and 40 ms interstimulus intervals, comparing them with a single stimulus condition assumed as baseline. In nine patients, who had a significant reduction in headache frequency after treatment, the recovery cycles of the P24 (P = 0.03) and N30 (P < 0.005) potentials were longer after than before topiramate treatment. In two migraineurs who did not show any improvement, the recovery cycles of the cortical SEP components were even shorter after treatment. Our results suggest that topiramate efficacy in paediatric migraine prophylaxis is probably related to restored cortical excitability.",

"Lung tumor tracking during stereotactic radiotherapy with the CyberKnife requires the insertion of markers in or close to the tumor. To reduce the risk of pneumothorax, three methods of marker placement were used: 1) intravascular coil placement, 2) percutaneous intrathoracal, and 3) percutaneous extrathoracal placement. We investigated the toxicity of marker placement and the tumor response of the lung tumor tracking treatment. Markers were placed in 20 patients with 22 tumors: 13 patients received a curative treatment, seven a palliative. The median Charlson Comorbidity Score was 4 (range: 1-8). Platinum fiducials and intravascular embolisation coils were used as markers. In total, 78 markers were placed: 34 intrathoracal, 23 intravascular and 21 extrathoracal. The PTV equaled the GTV + 5 mm. A median dose of 45 Gy (range: 30-60 Gy, in 3 fractions) was prescribed to the 70-85% isodose. The response was evaluated with a CTscan performed 6-8 weeks after the last treatment and routinely thereafter. The median follow-up was 4 months (range: 2-11). No severe toxicity due to the marker placement was seen. Pneumothorax was not seen. The local control was 100%. Four tumors in four patients showed a complete response, 15 tumors in 14 patients a partial response, and three tumors in two patients with metastatic disease had stable disease. No severe toxicity of marker placement was seen due to the appropriate choice of one of the three methods. CyberKnife tumor tracking with markers is feasible and resulted in excellent tumor response. Longer follow-up is needed to validate the local control.",

"After cardiac transplant, there is often development of restrictive cardiac physiology. Little is known about the factors that contribute to this physiology and its correlation with pathology. Heart retransplantation provides a valuable opportunity to further understand this relationship. In this study, we investigated the correlation of myocardial fibrosis and restrictive physiology, and possible risk factors utilizing data from all retransplants at our center. A retrospective review of the 30 patients who underwent retransplantation at our institution between 1994 and 2004 was performed. Hemodynamic and imaging data were reviewed for the presence of restrictive physiology. Pathology reports were reviewed for the presence of myocardial fibrosis in the explanted hearts. The cohort with restrictive physiology preceding redo heart transplant had significantly more patients exhibiting myocardial fibrosis compared with the non-restrictive physiology group (94.1% vs. 15.4%, p < 0.001). We found no difference in the immunosuppressive regimen, history of rejection, and reason for transplant. In our study, we observed that myocardial fibrosis is an important contributor to the development of restrictive physiology.

"Resorption of the alveolar ridge may lead to ridge deformities that make dental implant placement difficult or impossible. Augmentation of the alveolar ridge may restore appropriate ridge form to allow implant placement. Forty-four patients with edentulous spaces completed this multicenter prospective trial to clinically and radiographically evaluate the efficacy of a bovine pericardium membrane and a particulate mineralized cancellous bone allograft in promoting lateral ridge augmentation. Overall, 38 of 44 patients (86.4%) were able to receive dental implants in the appropriate restoratively driven position 6 months after ridge augmentation. The mean gain in clinical ridge width after augmentation was 2.61 mm, while radiographically the mean gain in ridge width was 1.65 mm at a level 3 mm apical to the bony crest and 1.93 mm at a level 6 mm apical to the crest. On average, approximately 50% of the graft material added horizontally during surgery was displaced or resorbed during healing. Histomorphometric evaluation of cores taken from the augmented ridge at 6 months revealed that approximately 58% of the tissue volume was vital bone, with 12% residual allograft particles and 30% nonmineralized tissue.",
"The HIV-TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) can complicate combined treatments for HIV-1 and TB. Little is known about tissue damage in TB-IRIS. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade components of the extracellular matrix and consequently may play a role in such immunopathology. Here we investigated the involvement of MMPs in TB-IRIS. We determined MMP transcript abundance and secreted protein in Mycobacterium tuberculosis stimulated PBMCs from 22 TB-IRIS patients and 22 non-IRIS controls. We also measured MMP protein levels in corresponding serum and the effect of prednisone--which reduces the duration of symptoms in IRIS patients--or placebo treatment on MMP transcript and circulating MMP protein levels. PBMCs from TB-IRIS had increased MMP-1, -3, -7, and -10 transcript levels when compared with those of controls at either 6 or 24 h. Similarly, MMP-1, -3, -7, and -10 protein secretion in stimulated cultures was higher in TB-IRIS than in controls. Serum MMP-7 concentration was elevated in TB-IRIS and 2 weeks of corticosteroid therapy decreased this level, although not significantly.

"This paper examines the relationship between indoor residual spray (IRS) and malaria parasite infection in Gash Barka Zone, Eritrea, an area with near universal coverage of insecticide treated bednets (ITN) and already low malaria parasite prevalence. A community randomized control trial was conducted in 2009. Malaria parasite infection prevalence was 0.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.37-0.78%], with no significant difference detected between treatment and control areas. ITN possession remains high, with over 70% of households reporting ITN ownership [95% CI: 68.4-72.9]. ITN use among individuals within ITN-owning households was just under half [46.7% (95% CI: 45.4-48.0)]. Slight differences in ITN possession and use were detected between treatment and control areas. There was no significant difference in malaria parasite infection prevalence among individuals in households with â¥1 ITN compared to those in households without ITNs, nor among individuals reporting ITN use. Among individuals in ITN-owning households, sleeping under an ITN offered no statistically significant protection from malaria parasite infection. Community participation in environmental and larval habitat management activities was low: 17.9% (95% CI: 16.0-19.7). It is likely that IRS, larval habitat management and ITN distribution alone may be insufficient to interrupt transmission without corresponding high ITN use, sustained IRS application in areas where infections are clustered, and promptly seeking laboratory diagnosis and treatment of all fevers. Eritrea is ready for elimination, irrespective of inconclusive impact evaluation results.",

"We conducted a multicenter study to determine whether Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) cultures in automated broth-based systems could reliably be considered negative sooner than 6 weeks. Laboratory sites used Bactec MGIT or BacT/Alert and tracked results of time to detection of all mycobacteria (TTD-all, n = 1547) and of MTBC (TTD-MTBC, n = 466) over 6-month periods from primarily (93%) respiratory specimens. Cumulative percentages by day detected and median TTD of initial and follow-up specimens were analyzed. The median TTD-MTBC for MGIT (n = 6 sites) was 14 days. For laboratories using standard processing procedures, 100% of MTBC were detected from initial and follow-up specimens in 28 and 35 days, respectively, and no yield of MTBC on solid or MGIT liquid media was observed after 5 weeks. The median TTD-MTBC for BacT/Alert (n = 3 sites) was 18 days, with 95% and 100% detected within 37 and 42 days, respectively. Analysis of TTD of positive MTBC cultures in broth can predict the probability of culture negativity at defined time points. Receipt of interim negative reports earlier than 6 weeks could assist clinicians in considering alternative diagnoses and could alter the timing and prioritization of public health interventions. Laboratories should analyze their own TTD data to inform protocol decisions. Laboratories using MGIT could issue reports of no growth of MTBC on initial specimens as early as 4 weeks and for patients undergoing treatment as early as 5 weeks postinoculation.",

"Palpitations is a common complaint in patients who visit the emergency department (ED), with causes ranging from benign to life threatening. We analyzed the ED component of the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for 2001 through 2010 for visits with a chief complaint of palpitations and calculated nationally representative weighted estimates for prevalence, demographic characteristics, and admission rates. ED and hospital discharge diagnoses were tabulated and categorized, and recursive partitioning was used to identify factors associated with admission. An estimated 684,000 visits had a primary reason for visit of "palpitations" representing a national prevalence of 5.8 per 1,000 ED visits (0.58%, 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.64). Women and non-Hispanic whites were responsible for most visits. A cardiac diagnosis made up 34% of all ED diagnoses. The overall admission rate was 24.6% (95% confidence interval 21.2 to 28.1), with higher rates seen in the Midwest and Northeast compared with the West. Survey-weighted recursive partitioning revealed several factors associated with admission including age >50 years, male gender, cardiac ED diagnosis, tachycardia, hypertension, and Medicare insurance. In conclusion, palpitations are responsible for a significant minority of ED visits and are associated with a cardiac diagnosis roughly 1/3 of the time. This was associated with a relatively high admission rate, although significant regional variation in these rates exists.",

"We hypothesized that the addition of mitral valve replacement or repair (MVR) to implantation of continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (cf-LVAD) may further decrease pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) over Heartmate II (HMII) implantation alone. Patients undergoing MVR with concomitant HMII implantation were compared with those undergoing HMII implantation alone. Of the 57 patients undergoing cf-LVAD implantation, 21 (36.8%) underwent concomitant MVR and 36 (63.2%) underwent cf-LVAD implantation alone. Patients receiving MVR had greater decrement in PVR (59.4% vs. 35.2%, p = 0.01). Decrease in end-diastolic diameter was greater for patients receiving MVR but did not reach statistical significance (18.2 vs. 13.5 mm, p = 0.33). Duration of mechanical ventilation (121.6 vs. 181.4 hours, p = 0.45) and inotropic support (162.4 vs. 153.2 hours, p = 0.86), change in creatinine (0.19 vs. -0.26 mg/dl, p = 0.34), increase in bilirubin (2.54 vs. 1.55 mg/dl, p = 0.63), intensive care unit stay (168.0 vs. 231.5 hours, p = 0.38), and overall length of stay (32.0 vs. 42.5 days, p = 0.75) were similar. There was no difference in survival at 3 months (89.7% vs. 83.3%) and 1 year (83.7 vs. 67.3%, p = 0.34). Addition of MVR may result in greater decrement of PVR than HMII implantation alone.

"Laropiprant, an antagonist of the PGD(2) receptor, DP1, is effective in reducing the flushing symptoms associated with extended-release (ER) niacin and thereby improves the tolerability of niacin therapy for dyslipidemia. Because PGD(2) has been reported to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro, it has been speculated that antagonism of DP1 may enhance platelet reactivity. Three clinical studies evaluated the potential effect of laropiprant, with or without coadministration of ER niacin, on in vivo platelet function in healthy subjects and hypercholesterolemic or diabetic subjects by measuring urinary levels of 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) (11-dTxB(2)), a marker of in vivo platelet activation. Following 7 days of multiple-dose administration, coadministration of laropiprant with ER niacin did not increase urinary 11-dTxB(2) levels compared to ER niacin alone in healthy, hypercholesterolemic, or diabetic subjects. In hypercholesterolemic and diabetic subjects, laropiprant did not increase urinary 11-dTxB(2) levels compared to placebo. These results demonstrate that laropiprant does not enhance in vivo platelet reactivity, either alone or in combination with niacin.",

"Depressed parasympathetic activity has been proposed to be associated with an increased risk of sudden death. Parasympathetic effects (PE) on cardiac electrophysiology during exercise and recovery have not been studied in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. We performed noninvasive electrophysiological studies (NI-EPS) and characterized the electrophysiological properties of the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and ventricle in subjects with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction and dual-chamber defibrillators. NI-EPS were performed during rest, exercise, and recovery at baseline and after parasympathetic blockade with atropine to assess PE (the difference between parameter values in the 2 conditions). Ten subjects (9 men: age, 60 +/- 9 yr; and left ventricular ejection fraction, 29 +/- 8%) completed the study. All NI-EPS parameters decreased during exercise and trended toward rest values during recovery. PE at rest, during exercise, and during recovery, respectively, were on sinus cycle length, 320 +/- 71 (P = 0.0001), 105 +/- 60 (P = 0.0003), and 155 +/- 82 ms (P = 0.0002); on AV block cycle length, 137 +/- 136 (P = 0.09), 37 +/- 19 (P = 0.002), and 61 +/- 39 ms (P = 0.006); on AV interval, 58 +/- 32 (P = 0.035), 22 +/- 13 (P = 0.002), and 36 +/- 20 ms (P = 0.001); on ventricular effective refractory period, 15.8 +/- 11.3 (P = 0.02), 4.7 +/- 15.2 (P = 0.38), and 6.8 +/- 15.5 ms (P = 0.20); and on QT interval, 13 +/- 12 (P = 0.13), 3 +/- 17 (P = 0.6), and 20 +/- 23 (P = 0.04). In conclusion, we describe for the first time the changes in cardiac electrophysiology and PE during rest, exercise, and recovery in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction. PEs are preserved in these patients. Thus the role of autonomic changes in the pathophysiology of sudden death requires further exploration.",
"The objective of this paper was to assess prevalence and characteristics of anxiety and depression in migraine without aura and tension-type headache, either isolated or in combination. Although the association between headache and psychiatric disorders is undisputed, patients with migraine and/or tension-type headache have been frequently investigated in different settings and using different tests, which prevents meaningful comparisons. Psychiatric comorbidity was tested through structured interview and the MINI inventory in 158 adults with migraine without aura and in 216 persons with tension-type headache or migraine plus tension-type headache. 49 patients reported psychiatric disorders: migraine 10.9%, tension-type headache 12.8%, and migraine plus tension-type headache 21.4%. The MINI detected a depressive episode in 59.9, 67.0, and 69.6% of cases. Values were 18.4, 19.3, and 18.4% for anxiety, 12.7, 5.5, and 14.2%, for panic disorder and 2.3, 1.1 and 9.4% (p = 0.009) for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Multivariate analysis showed panic disorder prevailing in migraine compared with the other groups (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.2-7.0). The association was higher (OR 6.3; 95% CI 1.4-28.5) when migraine (with or without tension-type headache) was compared to pure tension-type headache. This also applied to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OR 4.8; 95% CI 1.1-20.9) in migraine plus tension-type headache. Psychopathology of primary headache can reflect shared risk factors, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and disease burden.",

"This study aimed to evaluate whether intermittent preventive treatment in infants with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTi-SP) had an effect on the acquisition of IgG against Plasmodium falciparum variant surface antigens (VSA) and growth-inhibitory antibodies in ManhiÃ§a, Mozambique. In addition, we assessed factors affecting the magnitude of these responses and the association between antibody levels and protection against malaria. IgG to VSA expressed by MOZ2, R29 and E8B parasite isolates were measured in plasma samples collected at 5, 9, 12 and 24 months of age by flow cytometry. Growth-inhibitory antibodies in dialyzed plasmas using GFP-D10 parasites were measured by flow cytometry at 12 and 24 months. IPTi-SP did not significantly modify the levels of IgG against VSA nor the growth-inhibitory capacity of antibodies up to 2 years of age. Age but not previous episodes of malaria influenced the magnitude of these responses. In addition, anti-VSA IgG levels were 7% higher in children with current P. falciparum infection and were associated with neighborhood of residence. Children aged 24 months had 10% less parasite growth than those aged 12 months (95% CI 0.88-0.93, P<0.0001). Growth-inhibitory antibodies correlated with levels of IgG against AMA-1, when evaluating the 10% (R(2)=0.444, P=0.049) and 20% (R(2)=0.230, P=0.037) highest inhibitory samples. None of the responses were associated with subsequent risk of malaria. In conclusion, IPTi-SP does not negatively affect the development of antibody responses thought to be major contributors to the acquisition of immunity to malaria in infancy.",

All patients with S/beta(thal) responded well to treatment. Longitudinal evaluation of Hb, HbF, and MCV showed a significant increase compared to baseline levels, but the pattern of HbF changes varied among patients. Changes in HbF and Hb correlated well with baseline HbF. Favorable clinical responses, as documented by decline in hospitalization days for vasoocclusive crisis and transfused units of packed red blood cells, were also noted. During treatment, 1 patient was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and 2 patients developed bilateral avascular necrosis of the femoral head. HU seems to be effective in a high proportion of young patients with sickle cell disease and in particular with S/beta(thal), but cannot eliminate occurrence of serious adverse events.",
"Antibodies to polymorphic antigens expressed during the parasites erythrocytic stages are important mediators of protective immunity against P. falciparum malaria. Therefore, polymorphic blood stage antigens like MSP3, EBA-175 and GLURP and variant surface antigens PfEMP1 and RIFIN are considered vaccine candidates. However, to what extent these antibodies to blood stage antigens are acquired during naive individuals' first infections has not been studied in depth. Using plasma samples collected from controlled experimental P. falciparum infections we show that antibodies against variant surface antigens, PfEMP1 and RIFIN as well as MSP3 and GLURP, are acquired during a single short low density P. falciparum infection in non-immune individuals including strain transcendent PfEMP1 immune responses. These data indicate that the immunogenicity of the variant surface antigens is similar to the less diverse merozoite antigens. The acquisition of a broad and strain transcendent repertoire of PfEMP1 antibodies may reflect a parasite strategy of expressing most or all PfEMP1 variants at liver release optimizing the likelihood of survival and establishment of chronic infections in the new host.",

"From April 2005 to April 2006, a phase 2 malaria vaccine trial in Kenya enrolled 400 children aged 12-47 months. Each received mixed supervised and unsupervised artemether-lumefantrine for uncomplicated malaria, using a standard six-dose regimen, by weight. Children were followed for detection of parasitemia and clinical malaria. A median of two negative malaria blood films occurred during every recurrent parasitemia (RP) episode, suggesting reinfection over late recrudescence. Median time to RP after starting artemether-lumefantrine was 37 days (36-38). Of 2,020 evaluable artemether-lumefantrine treatments, there were no RPs in 99% by day 14, 71% by day 28, and 41% by day 42. By World Health Organization standards, 71% of treatment courses had adequate responses. Although recrudescence in some cannot be ruled out, our cohort had a shorter median time to RP compared with other artemether-lumefantrine treatment studies. This underscores patient counseling on completing all treatment doses for optimal protection from RP.",
"The treatment efficacy of artesunate-amodiaquine (AQ) coformulated or copackaged, and the plasma and saliva concentrations of desethylamodiaquine (DEAQ), the active metabolite of AQ, were evaluated in 120 and 7 children, respectively, with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria treated with oral daily doses of the 2 formulations for 3 days. All children recovered clinically. Fever clearance (1.1 Â± 0.2 vs 1.0 Â± 0 days) and parasite clearance times (21.1 Â± 10.2 vs 19.0 Â± 7.0 hours) in artesunate-AQ coformulated and artesunate-AQ copackaged treated children, respectively, were similar. All children remained aparasitemic for at least 28 days. Blood and saliva samples were collected over 35 days and DEAQ in plasma and saliva was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. DEAQ was detectable in plasma and saliva within 40 minutes of oral administration of artesunate-AQ. DEAQ concentrations 7 days after the start of therapy were 247.8 and 125.1 ng/mL in plasma and saliva, respectively. The concentration-time curves of plasma and saliva in declining phases were approximately parallel giving a similar half-life of 169.1 Â± 16.4 and 142.8 Â± 6.5 hours in plasma and saliva, respectively. Clearance from plasma and saliva was also similar (335.6 and 443.4 mLÂ·hÂ·kg, respectively). Area under concentration-time curves (AUC0-35d) for plasma and saliva were 94,744.9 and 74,004.2 ngÂ·mLÂ·h, respectively. In general, Saliva-plasma concentration ratio was 0.25-0.4. DEAQ concentrations in saliva may be useful for monitoring therapy and for the evaluation of the disposition of AQ in children with falciparum malaria treated with AQ-based combination.",
"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an emerging treatment for pain but there is no class 1 study on its role in migraine prophylaxis. In this study we report the efficacy and safety of high-rate rTMS in migraine prophylaxis. Adult migraine patients having >4 attacks/month were randomized to high-rate rTMS or sham stimulation. Stimulation in the form of 10Â Hz rTMS, 600 pulses in 10 trains were delivered to the hot spot of the right abductor digiti minimi in 412Â s. Three sessions were delivered on alternate days. The outcome was defined at 1Â month. The primary outcome measures were reduction in headache frequency and severity >50Â % as assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

"Patients with bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs) are considered a relative contraindication to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). One of the main reasons is the presumed risk for residual aortic regurgitation (AR). However, case reports and small case series have suggested that TAVI can be successfully performed with acceptable clinical outcomes in high-risk patients with BAV. Within the large German TAVI Registry, we sought to evaluate TAVI in older high-risk patients with BAV. From January 2009 to June 2010, a total of 1,424 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI were prospectively enrolled into the German TAVI Registry. For the present analysis, patients with valve-in-valve procedures were excluded and those with BAV (n = 38, 3%) were compared with those with tricuspid aortic valve (TAV; n = 1357, 97%). Patient characteristics did not markedly differ and procedural success was very high in both groups. There was a higher rate of relevant AR (â¥II) after TAVI among patients with BAV (25 vs 15%, p = 0.05), whereas pacemakers were more often implanted in patients with TAV (17% vs 35%, p = 0.02). Thirty-day mortality rate was similar in both cohorts (11% vs 11%). In a Cox proportional regression analysis, BAV was not associated with higher 1-year mortality rate (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 1.41). In selected patients with BAV, TAVI can be performed with a satisfactory clinical result. Although the risk for relevant AR seems to be greater among patients with BAV, 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were not elevated compared with patients with TAV.",

Because activated iNKT cells are rich in adenosine A2A receptors which, when agonized, down-regulate the inflammatory cytokine expression that characterizes the cells, we have conducted a phase 1 trial of a constant infusion of low-dose regadenoson (an adenosine analogue with high A2A receptor specificity) to determine its safety and the capacity of a safe dose to down-regulate circulating iNKT cells in patients with SCD. We have found two dose rates that are both safe and effective and now plan a controlled Phase 2B clinical trial to determine whether our highest dose, administered as a 48-hour constant infusion, will induce faster remission in both painful vaso-occlusive crisis (pVOC) and acute chest syndrome (ACS).",

"Migraine is a widespread, relapsing, remittent syndrome. No animal model predicts whether test medications will be clinically useful. Using a modern, well-controlled, sophisticated study design, Derosier et al. demonstrates not only that a butalbital formulation has modest efficacy as an acute treatment for migraine but also that a sumatriptan-naproxen combination is superior. These conclusions are reached using a variety of internally consistent secondary efficacy end points. The primary end point chosen (highly conservative and fashionable in some academic circles) was a technical failure (and not a negative experimental finding). Migraine is intrinsically pleiomorphic: diverse treatment options help match patient with therapy. This study does not justify blanket bans on (admittedly hazardous) barbiturate therapies, and regulators should not impose end point conservatism to an extent that will stifle further progress.",

"From 1978 to 1985 96 patients with their first spontaneous pneumothorax were randomised into three groups, receiving either treatment with simple drainage (34 patients), drainage with tetracycline pleurodesis (33 patients), or drainage with talc pleurodesis (29 patients). There were 58 men and 38 women, aged 18-88 years. There was no significant difference between the three groups in the mean time in hospital or the period for which the drains were retained. The incidence of infection, persistent pneumothorax, and relapse while in hospital was also similar for the three groups. At follow-up in 1987-89 patients could be accounted for, with an average follow-up period of 4.6 years. The incidence of recurrence was 36% in the simple drainage group, 13% in the tetracycline pleurodesis group, and 8% in the talc pleurodesis group. The difference between the talc and simple drainage groups was significant. None of the methods caused severe short or long term side effects or changes in the follow-up chest radiograph. Thoracoscopy, performed on admission in 85 patients, showed normal appearances in 73 patients and small cysts in 12. The thoracoscopic findings were of no value in predicting recurrence. Talc pleurodesis resulted in a significantly lower recurrence rate than simple drainage, tetracycline pleurodesis having intermediate efficacy.",

"Patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) have various left ventricular (LV) shapes: reverse septal curvature (RSC, commonly familial), sigmoid septum (SS, common in hypertensives), and concentric hypertrophy (CH). Longitudinal (systolic and early diastolic) strain rate (SR) is sensitive in detecting regional myocardial dysfunction. We sought to determine differences in longitudinal SR of patients with obstructive HC, based on LV shapes. We studied 199 consecutive patients with HC (50% men) referred for surgical myectomy. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters were recorded. LV shapes were classified on echocardiography, using basal septal 1/3 to posterior wall ratio: RSC = ratio >1.3 (extending to mid and distal septum), SS = ratio >1.3 (extending only to basal 1/3), and concentric = ratio â¤1.3. Longitudinal systolic and early diastolic SRs were measured from apical 4- and 2-chamber views (VVI 2.0; Siemens, Erlangen). Distribution of RSC, SS, and CH was 50%, 28%, and 22%, respectively. Patients with RSC were significantly younger (47 Â± 12 vs 64 Â± 10 and 57 Â± 11, respectively) with lower hypertension (40% vs 71% and 67%, respectively) than patients with SS or CH (both p <0.001). Patients with RSC had lower global systolic (-0.99 Â± 0.3 vs -1.05 Â± 0.3 and -1.17 Â± 0.3) and early diastolic SR (0.95 Â± 0.4 vs 0.98 Â± 0.3 and 1.16 Â± 0.4) versus patients with SS and CH (in 1/s, both p <0.01), despite being much younger and less hypertensive. RSC was associated with abnormal global LV systolic (beta 0.16) and early diastolic (beta -0.17) SR (both p <0.01). In conclusion, patients with HC with RCS have significantly abnormal LV mechanics, despite being younger and less hypertensive. A combination of LV mechanics and shapes could help differentiate between genetically mediated and other causes of obstructive HC.",

"Headache syndromes often involve occipital and neck symptoms suggesting a functional connectivity between nociceptive trigeminal and cervical afferents. Several studies have suggested that pain relief in migraine and other types of headache can be achieved by local injections of steroids, local anaesthetics or a mixture of both in the area of greater occipital nerve (GON). Usually greater occipital nerve block (GONB) is performed by using local anaesthetics alone or with steroid. The rationale of performing a GONB for the treatment of chronic headache states is on the anatomical connections between trigeminal and upper cervical sensory fibres at the level of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. However, the reason for the improvement after GONB in primary headache is unknown. The objective of this study is to determine whether adding triamcinolone to local anaesthetics increased the efficacy of GONB and trigger point injections (TPIs) for chronic migraine (TM). Patients with TM were randomized to receive GONB and TPIs using lidocaine 2% and bupivacaine 0.5% + either saline or triamcinolone 40 mg. Particularly, a 10-ml syringe containing 4.5 ml of lidocaine 2%, 4.5 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% and 1 ml of either saline (group A) or triamcinolone 40 mg/ml (group B) was prepared for each patients. Patients were given bilateral GONB and TPIs in the cervical paraspinal and trapezius muscles bilaterally. 2 ml were injected into each GON at the medial third of the distance between the occipital protuberance and the mastoid process. In addition, 0.5 ml was injected into each of the 12 trigger points. The total injected volume was 10 ml. The primary outcome measure was the change in mean headache severity from before injection to 20 min after in the two groups. Secondary outcome measures were the change in mean neck pain, photophobia and phonofobia severity from before injection to 20 min after in the two groups. Patients documented headache and severity of associated symptoms for 4 weeks after injection. Changes in symptom severity were compared between the two groups. Thirty-seven patients were included. Twenty minutes after injection, mean headache severity decreased by 3.2 points in group A (p < 0.01) and by 3.1 points in group B (p < 0.01). Mean neck pain severity decreased by 1.5 points in group A (p < 0.01) and by 1.7 points in group B (p < 0.01). Mean duration of being headache-free was 2.7 +/- 3.8 days in group A and 1.0 +/- 1.1 days in group B (p = 0.67). None of the outcome measures differed significantly between the two groups. Both treatments were full tolerated. In our study, adding triamcinolone to local anaesthetic when performing GONB and TPIs was not associated with improved outcome in the sample of patients with TM. In both groups, the procedure resulted in significant and rapid relief of headache, neck pain, photophobia and phonofobia.",

We report that purified irradiated PfSPZ administered to 80 volunteers by needle inoculation in the skin was safe, but suboptimally immunogenic and protective. Animal studies demonstrated that intravenous immunization was critical for inducing a high frequency of PfSPZ-specific CD8(+), IFN-Î³-producing T cells in the liver (nonhuman primates, mice) and conferring protection (mice). Our results suggest that intravenous administration of this vaccine will lead to the prevention of infection with Pf malaria.",
"Pharmacokinetic differences between piperaquine (PQ) base and PQ tetraphosphate were investigated in 34 Papua New Guinean children aged 5 to 10 years treated for uncomplicated malaria with artemisinin-PQ (ART-PQ) base or dihydroartemisinin-PQ (DHA-PQ) tetraphosphate. Twelve children received ART-PQ base (two daily doses of 3 mg of ART and 18 mg of PQ base as granules/kg of body weight) as recommended by the manufacturer, with regular clinical assessment and blood sampling over 56 days. PQ concentrations in plasma samples collected from 22 children of similar ages with malaria in a previously published pharmacokinetic study of DHA-PQ tetraphosphate (three daily doses of 2.5 mg of ART and 20 mg of PQ tetraphosphate as tablets/kg of body weight) were available for comparison. The disposition of ART was also assessed in the 12 children who received ART-PQ base. Plasma PQ was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection, and ART was assayed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Multicompartment pharmacokinetic models for PQ and ART were developed using a population-based approach. ART-PQ base was well tolerated, and initial fever abatement and parasite clearance were prompt. There were no differences between the two treatments in the values for the PQ area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(0-â)), with medians of 49,451 (n = 12) and 44,556 (n = 22) Î¼g Â· h/liter for ART-PQ base and DHA-PQ tetraphosphate, respectively. Recurrent parasitemia was associated with lower PQ exposure. Using a two-compartment ART model, the median AUC(0-â) was 1,652 Î¼g Â· h/liter. There was evidence of autoinduction of ART metabolism (relative bioavailability for the second dose, 0.27). These and previously published data suggest that a 3-day ART-PQ base regimen should be further evaluated, in line with World Health Organization recommendations for all artemisinin combination therapies.",

Under the auspices of the Integrated Management of Physician-Delivered Alcohol Care for Tuberculosis Patients (IMPACT) study, a randomized, controlled effectiveness trial, and as an integrated component of tuberculosis treatment in Tomsk, Russia, we adapted two proven alcohol interventions to the delivery of care to 200 patients with alcohol use disorders. Tuberculosis providers performed screening for alcohol use disorders and also delivered naltrexone (with medical management) or a brief counseling intervention either independently or in combination as a seamless part of routine care. We report the innovations and challenges to intervention design, training, and delivery of both pharmacologic and behavioral alcohol interventions within programmatic tuberculosis treatment services. We also discuss the implications of these lessons learned within the context of meeting the challenge of providing evidence-based care in resource-limited settings.",

"The incidence of cerebrovascular events (CVEs) was investigated in 95 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with left atrial thrombus (LAT) diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and in 131 age- and sex-matched AF patients without LAT. Compared with patients without LAT, patients with LAT had a larger left atrial diameter (49 versus 44 mm, P < 0.0001), a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (40% versus 50%, P < 0.0001), a higher prevalence of spontaneous echocardiographic contrast (88% versus 25%, P < 0.001), a reduced left atrial appendage emptying velocity (0.25 versus 0.41 cm/s, P < 0.0001), and less use of antiarrhythmic drugs (61% versus 76%, P = 0.03). Before TEE, the prevalence of prior CVE was higher in LAT patients (20%) compared with patients without LAT (8%) (P = 0.01). Fifty-four of 95 LAT patients (57%) and 81 of 131 non-LAT patients (62%) were on warfarin before TEE. The incidence of prior CVE in LAT patients without warfarin (32%) was higher than that in non-LAT patients without warfarin (10%) (P = 0.02). The mortality rate in LAT patients with an international normalized ratio (INR) >or= 2.0 (42%) was higher than that in patients without LAT and an INR >or= 2.0 (11%) (P < 0.001). Fifty-one of 95 LAT patients (54%) underwent repeat TEE before cardioversion (48 patients received warfarin therapy). The thrombus resolved in 40 of 51 patients (78%) after the first TEE. There was no significant difference in INR between the patients with persistent and resolved LAT. AF patients with persistent LAT had a higher incidence of CVE (45%) than the patients with resolved LAT (5%) (P = 0.003). We suggest that patients with LAT be treated with warfarin to maintain an INR between 2.5 and 3.5 rather than between 2.0 and 3.0 because they are at a high risk for new thromboembolism.",

"In some patients with non-islet-cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICTH), a high molecular weight form of IGF-II (big IGF-II) derived from tumors is present in the circulation and might be associated with recurrent hypoglycemia. In this study, in order to survey the clinical characteristics of patients with IGF-II producing NICTH, we analyzed the medical records of 78 patients with NICTH (M/F 44/34, age 62+/-1.8, range; 9-86 years.) whose serum contained a large amount of big IGF-II. Hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric carcinoma were the most common causes of NICTH. The diameters of the tumors were more than 10 cm in 70% of the patients. Basal immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels were less than 3 microU/dl in 79% of the patients. Hypoglycemic attack was the onset of disease in 31 of 65 cases (48%), but the tumor was revealed prior to the occurrence of hypoglycemia in 34 cases (52%). Twenty-five of 47 (53%) patients had decreased serum potassium levels. These data suggested that hypoinsulinemic hypoglycemia associated with the presence of a large tumor supports the diagnosis of IGF-II producing NICTH. Hypokalemia was associated with hypoglycemia in some patients. The BMI (21.4+/-0.6 kg/m2) and serum total protein levels (6.6+/-0.1g/dl) were preserved at the occurrence of first hypoglycemic attack suggesting that malnutrition might not be the main cause of hypoglycemia in most patients.",

"Sickle cell anemia is the most common heritable hematological disease affecting humans. Although hydroxyurea is the most commonly used antisickling agent, several previous studies suggest that cromolyn sodium also prevents sickling when administered acutely. However, no previous studies have evaluated the safety or efficacy of prolonged administration of cromolyn to patients with sickle cell anemia. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to test the hypothesis that prolonged administration of cromolyn alone or in combination with hydroxyurea would decrease the incidence of pain crises and/or alter the chronic pain seen in patients with this disease. In this crossover, single-blind, in vivo and in vitro study, 17 patients with sickle cell disease were studied. Each patient had to fill out a standard pain chart. Every 3 months the patients' medications changed in the following manner: The first 3 months the patients used cromolyn sodium nasal spray; the second 3 months they received placebo nasal spray; the third 3 months they received cromolyn sodium nasal spray and hydroxyurea capsule; and the last 3 months they received hydroxyurea capsule and placebo nasal spray. The least pain was felt with the mixture of hydroxyurea capsule and cromolyn sodium nasal inhaler. Furthermore, with the other combinations of medications, there were no significant statistical changes in the number of sickled red blood cells. Every combination used in this survey had positive effects on decreasing the pain. cromolyn sodium nasal spray is significantly efficient in decreasing sickle cell crisis as well as pain intensity in patients with sickle cell anemia.",
"Forty-three homozygous (SS) female sickle cell anemic patients with a history of at least one painful crisis per month and desiring a reversible contraceptive were administered DMPA/3 months or Microgynon monthly.

No changes were observed in any of the groups in the hematological parameters. At the end of the study, 70% of the patients receiving DMPA were pain-free and only 16% of those still reporting painful crises rated them as intense. Patients receiving Microgynon also had an amelioration of the painful crises, although at a lower rate; after 12 months, 45.5% still experienced some crises. Although less marked than in the other groups, 50.5% of the control patients also reported an improvement of their painful crisis, which may be a result of closer medical care.",

"The safety of talc pleurodesis is under dispute following reports of talc-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. We investigated the safety of large-particle talc for thoracoscopic pleurodesis to prevent recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). 418 patients with recurrent PSP were enrolled between 2002 and 2008 in nine centres in Europe and South Africa. The main exclusion criteria were infection, heart disease and coagulation disorders. Serious adverse events (ARDS, death or other) were recorded up to 30 days after the procedure. Oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen use and temperature were recorded daily at baseline and after thoracoscopic pleurodesis (2 g graded talc). During the 30-day observation period following talc poudrage, no ARDS (95% CI 0.0-0.9%), intensive care unit admission or death were recorded. Seven patients presented with minor complications (1.7%, 95% CI 0.7-3.4%). After pleurodesis, mean body temperature increased by 0.41Â°C (95% CI 0.33-0.48Â°C; p<0.001) at day 1 and returned to baseline value at day 5. Pleural drains were removed after day 4 in 80% of patients. Serious adverse events, including ARDS or death, did not occur in this large, multicentre cohort. Thoracoscopic talc poudrage using larger particle talc to prevent recurrence of PSPS can be considered safe.",

"The aims of the present study were to identify risk factors associated with latent tuberculosis (TB), examine the development of active disease among contacts, and assess the effectiveness of treating latent infection in indigenous Brazilians from January 2006 to December 2011. This was a retrospective study consisting of 1,371 tuberculosis contacts, 392 of whom underwent treatment for latent infection. Morbidity-from-TB data were obtained from the Information System for Disease Notification (SINAN) database, and the contacts' data were collected from the clinical records using forms employed by Special Department of Indigenous Health (SESAI) multidisciplinary teams, according to SESAI's instructions. The variables that were associated with latent infection among the contacts were age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.04) and close contact with a smear-positive index case (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.59-3.22). The variables associated with the development of active TB among the contacts were a tuberculin skin test (TST) â¥10 mm (relative risk [RR]: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.07-1.17), age (RR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.03), and treatment of latent infection (RR: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01-0.27). The estimated number of latent infection treatments needed to prevent one case of active TB among the contacts was 51 treatments (95% CI: 33-182). In contacts with TST â¥10 mm, 10 (95% CI: 6-19) latent infection treatments were necessary to prevent one case of active TB. Age and close contact with a smear-positive index case were associated with latent TB. Screening with TST is a high priority among individuals contacting smear-positive index cases. Age and TST are associated with the development of active TB among contacts, and treatment of latent infection is an effective measure to control TB in indigenous communities.",

"There are sparse published data relating to the pharmacokinetic properties of artemether, lumefantrine, and their active metabolites in children, especially desbutyl-lumefantrine. We studied 13 Papua New Guinean children aged 5 to 10 years with uncomplicated malaria who received the six recommended doses of artemether (1.7 mg/kg of body weight) plus lumefantrine (10 mg/kg), given with fat over 3 days. Intensive blood sampling was carried out over 42 days. Plasma artemether, dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, and desbutyl-lumefantrine were assayed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or high-performance liquid chromatography. Multicompartmental pharmacokinetic models for a drug plus its metabolite were developed using a population approach that included plasma artemether and dihydroartemisinin concentrations below the limit of quantitation. Although artemether bioavailability was variable and its clearance increased by 67.8% with each dose, the median areas under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC(0-â)s) for artemether and dihydroartemisinin (3,063 and 2,839 Î¼g Â· h/liter, respectively) were similar to those reported previously in adults with malaria. For lumefantrine, the median AUC(0-â) (459,980 Î¼g Â· h/liter) was also similar to that in adults with malaria. These data support the higher dose recommended for children weighing 15 to 35 kg (35% higher than that for a 50-kg adult) but question the recommendation for a lower dose in children weighing 12.5 to 15 kg. The median desbutyl-lumefantrine/lumefantrine ratio in the children in our study was 1.13%, within the range reported for adults and higher at later time points because of the longer desbutyl-lumefantrine terminal elimination half-life. A combined desbutyl-lumefantrine and lumefantrine AUC(0-â) weighted on in vitro antimalarial activity was inversely associated with recurrent parasitemia, suggesting that both the parent drug and the metabolite contribute to the treatment outcome of artemether-lumefantrine.",

"Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type IIa is rare, occurring in 20% to 30% of the patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical findings, surgical therapy, and outcome for 56 patients affected by PHPT among 249 MEN-IIa patients collected from 84 families assembled by the Groupe d'Etude des Tumeurs Ã¡ Calcitonine (GETC, French Calcitonin Tumors Study Group). This retrospective study was based on cases registered by the GETC (20 participating centers) from 1969 to 1994. Characteristics of PHPT in 56 patients (31 women, 25 men) with MEN-IIa were reviewed. All but two underwent cervicotomy. The median age at diagnosis was 37.6 years. PHPT was found concomitantly with medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or pheochromocytoma in 43 patients (77%). PHPT was asymptomatic in 68% of the patients. Serum calcium levels ranged from 2.20 to 3.70 mmol/L (median 2.82 mmol/L; normal 2. 10-2.60 mmol/L). The number of parathyroid glands removed at surgery was 0 (n = 2), 1 (n = 24), 2 (n = 5), > 2 (n = 12), 4 (n = 11). Pathology (initial surgery) consisted of 24 adenomas, 4 double adenomas, and 25 hyperplasia. Cure after initial surgery was obtained in 89%, including a 22% incidence of hypoparathyroidism. There were 6 cases (11%) with persistent PHPT. With a mean follow-up of 6.4 years, five patients (9%) had recurrent PHPT. The results indicate that MEN-IIa-related PHPT is generally associated with mild, often asymptomatic hypercalcemia. Despite recurrences encountered 5 to 15 years after the first cervicotomy, resection of only macroscopically enlarged glands generally appears sufficient. Subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation is associated with a high rate of hypoparathyroidism.",

"Prostacyclin [prostaglandin I(2) (PGI(2))] activates and sensitizes meningeal sensory afferents. In healthy subjects PGI(2) triggers headache in healthy subjects. However, the migraine-eliciting effect of PGI(2) has not been systematically studied in patients with migraine. We hypothesized that intravenous infusion of the stable prostacyclin analogue epoprostenol would trigger migraine-like attacks in migraineurs. We infused 10 ng kg(-1) min(-1) PGI(2) or placebo over 25 min in 12 migraineurs without aura in a controlled, double-blind, cross-over study and recorded headache intensity and associated symptoms, velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V(MCA)) and diameter in the superficial temporal artery. In the period 0-14 h, 12 subjects reported headache on PGI(2) day compared with three subjects on placebo day (P = 0.004), and six subjects fulfilled the criteria for an experimentally induced migraine-like attack compared with two subjects on placebo (P = 0.219). During infusion and post-infusion phases the AUC under the headache curve on PGI(2) was significantly larger than on placebo (P < 0.05). There was a significant V(MCA) decrease (P = 0.015) and superficial temporal artery diameter increase (P < 0.001) on PGI(2) compared with placebo. In conclusion, PGI(2) may trigger a migraine-like attack in migraine sufferers. We suggest sensitization of perivascular nociceptors and arterial dilation as the mode of action of PGI(2)-induced headache and migraine-like attacks.",

"Only a few studies have focused on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of non-ST-segment myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) during off-hours. The purpose of this study was to compare the impact of patients' arrival time on the care of NSTEMI and whether this pattern might affect hospital mortality. This study analyzed 4,736 NSTEMI patients included in the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry from November 2005 to January 2008. Patients' arrival time was classified into regular hours (weekdays, 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) and off-hours (weekdays 18:01 p.m. to 8:59 a.m., weekends, and holidays). A subtotal of 2,225 (46.9%) patients was admitted during off hours, compared with 2,511 (53.1%) patients with regular-hour admission. A higher proportion of patients admitted during off-hours had a higher Killip class, had more frequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation, were less likely to receive percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (67.7% vs 72.7%, p <0.001), and had longer door-to-balloon times (28 hours, interquartile range: 11 to 63 vs 23 hours, interquartile range 4 to 67, p <0.001). Although unadjusted hospital mortality was associated with admission during off-hours (4.5% vs 3.3%, p = 0.023), after adjusting for all patients covariates, the difference in mortality was attenuated and was no longer statistically significant (odds ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.48, p = 0.793). In conclusion, despite receiving fewer PCIs and having substantially longer waiting times to PCI, patients admitted during off-hours may not be at risk for increased in-hospital mortality. If patients are treated within an appropriate reperfusion strategy according to their clinical risk, arrival time may not influence on mortality.",

"To evaluate the effects of antimalarial drugs on Plasmodium falciparum malaria-associated anemia, we use the area under the curve (AUC) of anemia levels after treatment as an approach to combine their duration and magnitude. The method involves numeric estimation, by trapezoidal rule, of AUC from a plot of deficit in hematocrit levels from 30% (the lower threshold of normal) versus time in anemic children. Using the method, we evaluated, in randomized trials, the effects of artesunate-mefloquine versus mefloquine alone and artemether-lumefantrine versus amodiaquine-artesunate on the time course of recovery from malaria-associated anemia in 109 children. Anemia resolution times were similar (10.9 Â± 6.2 [standard deviation] versus 13.3 Â± 8.9 days, P = 0.2), but mean AUC was significantly lower in artesunate-mefloquine- compared with mefloquine-treated children (35.5 Â± 7.1 [standard error of mean] versus 49.8 Â± 11.3 %Â·h, P = 0.02) indicating larger exposure to anemia in mefloquine-treated children. In artemether-lumefantrine- and amodiaquine-artesunate-treated children, both anemia resolution times (8.6 Â± 5.3 [standard deviation] versus 8.6 Â± 4.8 days, P = 0.98) and mean AUC (57.1 Â± 12.9 [standard error of mean] versus 46.3 Â± 8.7 %Â·h, P = 0.74) were similar. Estimation of AUC appears more robust than estimation of anemia resolution time in evaluating antimalarial drug effects and can be used in both observational studies and clinical trials assessing the effects of therapies on malaria-associated anemia.",

"The roles of the NAT2 genotype and enzyme maturation on isoniazid pharmacokinetics were investigated in South African infants with perinatal HIV exposure enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial of isoniazid for prevention of tuberculosis disease and latent infection. Plasma concentration-time measurements of isoniazid from 151 infants (starting at 3-4 months of age) receiving isoniazid 10 to 20 mg/kg/d orally during the course of the 24-month study were incorporated in a population analysis along with NAT2 genotype, body weight, age, and sex. The results showed a different NAT2 enzyme maturation profile for each of the 3 acetylation groups, with the 70-kg body weight-normalized typical apparent clearance for the fast and intermediate acetylators increasing from 14.25 L/h and 10.88 L/h at 3 months of age to 22.84 L/h and 15.58 L/h at 24 months of age, respectively, with no significant change in the apparent clearance of the slow group during this period.

"Warfarin decreases risk of stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) dependent on percent time in the therapeutic range (TTR) with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2 to 3. We hypothesized that gender differences in ischemic stroke risk are related to TTR. From the AFFIRM database of 4,060 patients with AF, we determined the incidence of ischemic stroke by gender. We evaluated the INR at time of ischemic stroke and calculated TTR. We determined the relation between gender and ischemic stroke by TTR. Women had CHADS(2) Scores (3.7 Â± 1.3 vs 2.5 Â± 1.3, p <0.0001) and more ischemic strokes than men (5% vs 3%, odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 2.26, p = 0.002). Mean INR near time of ischemic stroke was 2 for women and men; median values were subtherapeutic (1.7 and 1.8, respectively). Women spent more time outside the therapeutic range (40 Â± 0.7% vs 37 Â± 0.5%, p = 0.0001), with more time below the therapeutic range (29 Â± 0.7% vs 26 Â± 0.5%, p = 0.0002). A higher TTR protected against ischemic stroke for women but not for men. Women who had a comparably high TTR (â¥66%) still had more ischemic strokes (p = 0.009). A fitted Cox proportional hazard regression model showed that gender, TTR <46% versus >80%, age, and previous stroke were significantly related to stroke incidence. In conclusion, women in AFFIRM were at greater risk of ischemic stroke than men, in part related to differences in TTR. Women with AF may benefit from more aggressive or novel anticoagulation to decrease their risk of stroke.",

"Triptan use in EM is associated with an increased risk of CM onset that increases with days of medication use. For NSAIDs, effects depend on headache days per month. NSAIDs are protective in individuals with less than 10 headache days per month but associated with increased risk with 10 or more headache days per month.

"After considerably interfering with exposure during the first year of life, there was a trend towards a higher risk of malaria in the second year in children who had received chemoprophylaxis, but there was no significant rebound.

Thus, the timing of administration of antimalarial interventions like malaria vaccines during infancy does not appear to be a critical determinant.",
"In the past two decades, two landmark randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been completed among individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), the Multi-center Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH) trial and the Stroke Prevention (STOP) trial. The MSH trial tested the hypothesis that hydroxyurea will reduce the frequency of painful episodes for adults with hemoglobin SS who had a history of 3 or more painful episodes per year. The STOP trial tested the hypothesis that among children with hemoglobin SS and an elevated transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocity measurement, blood transfusion therapy would decrease the risk of an initial stroke. After completion, both trials have defined standard care for individuals with hemoglobin SS. The purpose of this review is to examine the limitations of the MSH and STOP trials. In the context of these trials, we will examine the effects of narrow inclusion criteria that primarily include participants with hemoglobin SS and secondary analyses that are prone to false-positive results. In addition, we describe how after publication of these two trials use of hydroxyurea and TCD assessment has drifted towards a standard practice without evidence of therapeutic efficacy among groups that were excluded from the trials. Finally, we suggest that rigorously conducted RCTs or at the minimum multicenter observation studies with strong methodology should be performed in these excluded subgroups to confirm a benefit of hydroxyurea or TCD measurement.",

"Riata family of implantable cardioverter defibrillator leads have demonstrated in situ conductor externalization, prompting a class I recall and the Food and Drug Administration recommendation for fluoroscopic screening. The natural history of externalized Riata leads, however, remains unclear. In this study, we examined the rate of electrical failure in Riata leads with externalized cables. We reviewed medical and implantable cardioverter defibrillator records of all 329 patients with Riata leads who underwent fluoroscopic screening from December 2011 to March 2012 at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center hospitals. Externalization was present in 76 patients (23%); of whom, 24 (32%) had the Riata lead replaced shortly after screening. The remaining 52 patients were followed for 7.9 Â± 2.9 months, during which 5 patients were lost to follow-up and 2 patients exhibited electrical lead failure resulting in lead replacement, an electrical failure rate of 6.4% per year in externalized leads. In conclusion, prospective follow-up data on externalized Riata leads suggest an electrical failure rate in excess of 6% per year. This high failure rate warrants consideration of prophylactic replacement of externalized Riata leads. Further studies examining the natural history of Riata leads are warranted.",

"The prevalence, intensity, safety, and efficacy of oral anticoagulation (OAC) in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in "real-world" patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have not yet been fully evaluated. In the Coronary REvascularization Demonstrating Outcome Study in Kyoto registry cohort-2, a total of 1,057 patients with AF (8.3%) were identified among 12,716 patients undergoing first PCI. Cumulative 5-year incidence of stroke was higher in patients with AF than in no-AF patients (12.8% vs 5.8%, p <0.0001). Although most patients with AF had CHADS2 score â¥2 (75.2%), only 506 patients (47.9%) received OAC with warfarin at hospital discharge. Cumulative 5-year incidence of stroke in the OAC group was not different from that in the no-OAC group (13.8% vs 11.8%, pÂ = 0.49). Time in therapeutic range (TTR) was only 52.6% with an international normalized ratio of 1.6 to 2.6, and only 154 of 409 patients (37.7%) with international normalized ratio data had TTR â¥65%. Cumulative 5-year incidence of stroke in patients with TTR â¥65% was markedly lower than that in patients with TTR <65% (6.9% vs 15.1%, pÂ = 0.01). In a 4-month landmark analysis in the OAC group, there was a trend for higher cumulative incidences of stroke and major bleeding in the on-DAPT (nÂ = 286) than in the off-DAPT (nÂ = 173) groups (15.1% vs 6.7%, pÂ = 0.052 and 14.7% vs 8.7%, pÂ = 0.10, respectively). In conclusion, OAC was underused and its intensity was mostly suboptimal in real-world patients with AF undergoing PCI, which lead to inadequate stroke prevention. Long-term DAPT in patients receiving OAC did not reduce stroke incidence.",

"Increased, decreased or normal excitability to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been reported in the motor (M1) and visual cortices of patients with migraine. Light deprivation (LD) has been reported to modulate M1 excitability in control subjects (CS). Still, effects of LD on M1 excitability compared to exposure to environmental light exposure (EL) had not been previously described in patients with migraine (MP). To further our knowledge about differences between CS and MP, regarding M1 excitability and effects of LD on M1 excitability, we opted for a novel approach by extending measurement conditions. We measured motor thresholds (MTs) to TMS, short-interval intracortical inhibition, and ratios between motor-evoked potential amplitudes and supramaximal M responses in MP and CS on two different days, before and after LD or EL. Motor thresholds significantly increased in MP in LD and EL sessions, and remained stable in CS. There were no significant between-group differences in other measures of TMS. Short-term variation of MTs was greater in MP compared to CS. Fluctuation in excitability over hours or days in MP is an issue that, until now, has been relatively neglected. The results presented here will help to reconcile conflicting observations.",

"Over the past three decades physicians have used light level laser therapy (LLLT) for the management and the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and have obtained results that calls for further investigations. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of LLLT in treatment of pain symptoms in patients with diabetic polyneuropathy. In this study 60 patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy were matched based on their sex, age, BMI, type of diabetes, duration of diabetes, and duration of pain, and randomized to case and control groups based on their established scores on the visual analog scale (VAS) and the Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS). Cases received laser therapy with wavelength of 78 nm and 2.5 j/cm2 two times a week, each time for 5 min, for one month. During the same period, controls received sham laser therapy. Comparing the differences between the two groups' VAS and TCSS mean scores before the intervention with that of the 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the intervention we were able to see a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P&lt;0.05). On the other hand, when we compared their VAS and TCSS mean scores 4 weeks and 2 weeks after the intervention we did not find any statistically significant difference between the two groups. We achieved the same results when we examined cases' and controls' pre and post VAS and TCSS scores independent from each other; no improvement in the assessment based on their 2 and 4 weeks comparisons tests. Laser therapy resulted in improved neuropathy outcomes in diabetic patients who received it relative to the group that received sham therapy, evaluating before and after LLLT assessments. Further studies are needed to test types of lasers, as well as different dosage and exposure levels required in different phase of neuropathic care, so as to obtain reproducible results.",

"Therapeutics which reduce the pathology in sickle cell syndromes are needed, particularly noncytotoxic therapeutics. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF, Î±(2) Î³(2) ) is established as a major regulator of disease severity; increased HbF levels correlate with milder clinical courses and improved survival. Accordingly, sodium dimethylbutyrate (HQK-1001), an orally-bioavailable, promoter-targeted fetal globin gene-inducing agent, was evaluated in a randomized, blinded, dose-ranging Phase I/II trial in 24 adult patients with HbSS or S/Î² thalassemia, to determine safety and tolerability of three escalating dose levels. The study therapeutic was administered once daily for two 6-week cycles, with a two-week interim dose holiday. Twenty-one patients completed the study. Five patients received study drug at 10 or 20 mg/kg doses, seven patients received study drug at 30 mg/kg/dose, and 4 patients received placebo. HQK-1001 was well-tolerated with no unexpected drug-related adverse events; a dose-limiting toxicity was not identified. Plasma drug levels were sustained above targeted levels for 24 hr. Increases in HbF above baseline were observed particularly with 30 mg/kg/day doses; in five of seven treated patients, a mean absolute increase in HbF of 0.2 g/dl and a mean increase in total hemoglobin (Hgb) of 0.83 g/dl above baseline were observed, whereas no increases occurred in placebo-treated controls. These findings of favorable PK profiles, tolerability, early rises in HbF, and total Hgb indicate that trials of longer duration appear warranted to more definitively evaluate the therapeutic potential of HQK-1001 in sickle cell disease.",
"Although CXR is less sensitive in detecting parenchymal and pleural injuries than CT, the majority of the injuries identified by CT alone are minor and require no treatment. CXR remains the primary modality for diagnostic evaluation of blunt thoracic trauma.",
"We describe herein our new technique of performing video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) using a flexible scope and a bleb implement which allows for a reduction in the risk of overlooking small and flat blebs in patients with a spontaneous pneumothorax (SP). This technique was performed in 26 consecutive patients with a SP. A skin incision about 18 mm long was made in the area over which the patients had specified preoperatively, and meticulous observation of the apex and superior segment was performed using a bleb implement. Partial pneumonectomy with endoscopic staplers and laser ablation were carried out for pleural lesions. We found that VATS combined with a flexible scope and a bleb implement resulted in better visibility for detection and removal of any small and flat blebs.",
"Quinine is a standard drug for treating severe malaria in Africa, and it is also increasingly used to treat uncomplicated disease. However, failures of quinine therapy are common, and it is unknown if failures in Africa are due to drug resistance. Recent studies have identified associations between in vitro quinine sensitivity and polymorphisms in genes encoding putative transporters, including well-described polymorphisms in pfcrt and pfmdr1 and varied numbers of DNNND or DDNHNDNHNND repeats in microsatellite 4760 (ms4760) of the predicted sodium-hydrogen exchanger, pfnhe1. To better characterize mediators of quinine response, we assessed associations between genetic polymorphisms, in vitro quinine sensitivity, and quinine treatment responses in Kampala, Uganda. Among 172 fresh clinical isolates tested in vitro, decreasing sensitivity to quinine was associated with accumulation of pfmdr1 mutations at codons 86, 184, and 1246. Nearly all parasites had pfcrt 76T, preventing analysis of associations with this mutation. pfnhe1 ms4760 was highly polymorphic. Parasites with 2 copies of either ms4760 repeat showed modest decreases in quinine sensitivity compared to those with 1 or â¥3 repeats, but the differences were not statistically significant. None of the above polymorphisms predicted treatment failure among 66 subjects treated with quinine for uncomplicated malaria. Our data suggest that quinine sensitivity is a complex trait and that known polymorphisms in pfcrt, pfmdr1, and pfnhe1, while associated with quinine sensitivity, are not robust markers for quinine resistance.",

"The aim of this phase IIA clinical trial was to assess the efficacy of an 80â% ethanolic quantified extract (containing 5.6â% strictosamide as the putative active constituent) from Nauclea pobeguinii stem bark denoted as PR 259 CT1 in a small group of adult patients diagnosed with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Results obtained from a phase I clinical trial on healthy male volunteers indicated that the oral administration during meals of two 500âmg capsules three times daily (each eight hours) during seven days was well tolerated and showed only mild and self-resolving adverse effects. This PR 259 CT1 drug regimen was obtained by mathematical conversion of animal doses obtained in several in vivo studies in mice to human equivalent doses as in falciparum malaria patients. The phase IIA study was an open cohort study in eleven appraisable adult patients suffering from proven Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The study was specifically designed to assess the efficacy of PR 259 CT1 administered with a dose regimen of two 500âmg capsules three times daily for three days, followed by outpatient treatment of one 500âmg capsule three times daily for the next four days, in order to prove that this therapeutic dose, which was calculated from animal doses, was effective to treat adult malaria patients and consequently useful for a future Phase IIB clinical trial. This study would then substitute a dose-escalating trial, which in general is used to find the appropriate dose for clinical studies. The phase IIA clinical trial was carried out according to the WHO 2003 14-day test, and the results revealed that all eleven patients were completely cleared of parasitemia and fever on days 3, 7, and 14 except for one patient, who experienced a recurrence of parasitemia at days 7 until 14. Besides this adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR), this trial also demonstrated that PR 259 CT1 was well tolerated with only mild and self-resolving adverse effects including fatigue and headache, which were in accordance with those found in the phase I clinical trial. Moreover, all symptoms progressively disappeared, and no symptoms were observed on day 14. Although the number of patients included in this study was rather limited, the statistical analysis nevertheless suggested the efficacy and tolerability of PR 259 CT1, which indicated that this herbal medicinal product might be considered as a putative candidate for a large scale clinical trial.",

"Three potentially protective responses to hypoxia have been reported to be enhanced in divers: (1) the diving response, (2) the blood-boosting spleen contraction, and (3) a long-term enhancement of hemoglobin concentration (Hb). Longitudinal studies, however, have been lacking except concerning the diving response. Ten untrained subjects followed a 2-week training program with 10 maximal effort apneas per day, with pre- and posttraining measurements during three maximal duration apneas, and an additional post-training series when the apneic duration was kept identical to that before training. Cardiorespiratory parameters and venous blood samples were collected across tests, and spleen diameters were measured via ultrasound imaging. Maximal apneic duration increased by 44 s (P < 0.05). Diving bradycardia developed 3 s earlier and was more pronounced after training (P < 0.05). Spleen contraction during apneas was similar during all tests. The arterial hemoglobin desaturation (SaO2) nadir after apnea was 84% pretraining and 89% after the duration-mimicked apneas post-training (P < 0.05), while it was 72% (P < 0.05) after maximal apneas post-training. Baseline Hb remained unchanged after training, but reticulocyte count increased by 15% (P < 0.05). We concluded that the attenuated SaO2 decrease during mimic apneas was due mainly to the earlier and more pronounced diving bradycardia, as no enhancement of spleen contraction or Hb had occurred. Increased reticulocyte count suggests augmented erythropoiesis.",
"FIRM mapping revealed a median of 2 (interquartile range: 1 to 2) rotors or focal sources in 97.7% of patients during AF. During a median follow-up period of 890 days (interquartile range: 224 to 1,563 days), compared to FIRM-blinded therapy, patients receiving FIRM-guided ablation maintained higher freedom from AF after 1.2 Â± 0.4 procedures (median 1; interquartile range: 1 to 1) (77.8% vs. 38.5%, pÂ = 0.001) and a single procedure (p < 0.001) and higher freedom from all atrial arrhythmias (pÂ = 0.003).

"In this prospective case-series study, a balanced anesthetic scheme of sevoflurane in nitrous oxide supplemented with remifentanil and sustained neuromuscular block was applied in nine patients scheduled for laparoscopic adrenalectomy for pheochromocytoma. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy to treat pheochromocytoma results in marked catecholamine release during pneumoperitoneum and tumor manipulation. Remifentanil infusion was adjusted to maintain systolic arterial pressure between 120-170 mmHg. Increased infusion rate of remifentanil was used (up to 3 microg/kg/min) to prevent and treat marked hemodynamic changes from catecholamine release during tumor manipulation. Hpotension after tumor removal was treated with additional colloids fluids and decreasing the remifentanil infusion rate by 25-50%.",
"Migraine headaches are common in children. Early diagnosis and appropriate interventions are mandatory to prevent decades of suffering and diminished quality of life. There is need for data regarding the efficacy and safety of prophylactic agents in children with migraine; therefore, we designed a randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of cinnarizine with that of a well-known prophylactic agent (propranolol) in the prophylaxis of pediatric migraine headache. A total of 120 patients aged between 6 and 17Â years were recruited and 113 patients succeeded in completing all phases of the trial. Of them, 57 patients were given cinnarizine, and propranolol was administered in 56 patients. Reduction in headache frequency was the main response to treatment. Cinnarizine reduced the baseline headache frequency by more than 50% in 74.6% of patients and the mean headache frequency per month was reduced from 11.851Â Â±Â 0.739 (meanÂ Â±Â SEM) to 3.358Â Â±Â 0.739 (meanÂ Â±Â SEM) attacks per month (PÂ <Â 0.001). In the propranolol group, more than 50% reduction of the baseline headache frequency was seen in 72.5% of patients and the mean headache frequency per month was reduced from 10.264Â Â±Â 0.830 (meanÂ Â±Â SEM) to 2.774Â Â±Â 0.830 (meanÂ Â±Â SEM) attacks per month (PÂ <Â 0.001). No significant difference was seen in 50% reduction of the baseline headache frequency between treatment groups (PÂ =Â 0.358). No significant adverse effects were reported. In this open study, cinnarizine appeared thus as effective as propranolol and safe for the prophylaxis of migraine in children, but this remains to be confirmed in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial.",

"We have recently completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, noncrossover study, the goal of which was to determine whether cetiedil citrate (cetiedil) could affect the course of vaso-occlusive crises in sickle cell disease. Patients, who presented to the emergency room at least 4 but no more than 24 hours after the onset of a painful vasoocclusive crisis severe enough to require hospitalization, were considered candidates for the study. Each patient received either placebo or cetiedil at one of the following three dosages: 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4 mg/kg body weight. The assigned drug dosage was given as a 30 minute intravenous infusion every 8 hours for 4 consecutive days. A total of 67 patients was enrolled in the study. Cetiedil, at its highest dosage (0.4 mg/kg body weight), was found to be significantly superior to placebo both in reducing the number of painful sites present on all 4 treatment days and in shortening the total time in crisis. No serious adverse reactions were observed during the course of the study. We conclude that cetiedil, given at a dosage of 0.4 mg/kg body weight, is therapeutically advantageous for sickle cell crisis.",

"Plasmodium falciparum: apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is a candidate malaria vaccine antigen expressed on merozoites and sporozoites. The polymorphic nature of AMA1 may compromise vaccine induced protection. The humoral response induced by two dosages (10 and 50 Âµg) of a single allele AMA1 antigen (FVO) formulated with Alhydrogel, Montanide ISA 720 or AS02 was investigated in 47 malaria-naÃ¯ve adult volunteers. Volunteers were vaccinated 3 times at 4 weekly intervals and serum samples obtained four weeks after the third immunization were analysed for (i) Antibody responses to various allelic variants, (ii) Domain specificity, (iii) Avidity, (iv) IgG subclass levels, by ELISA and (v) functionality of antibody responses by Growth Inhibition Assay (GIA). About half of the antibodies induced by vaccination cross reacted with heterologous AMA1 alleles. The choice of adjuvant determined the magnitude of the antibody response, but had only a marginal influence on specificity, avidity, domain recognition or subclass responses. The highest antibody responses were observed for AMA1 formulated with AS02. The Growth Inhibition Assay activity of the antibodies was proportional to the amount of antigen specific IgG and the functional capacity of the antibodies was similar for heterologous AMA1-expressing laboratory strains.",

"A randomized double-blind clinical trial was performed to test the safety and efficacy of a low-molecular-weight heparin, tinzaparin (Innohep), for the management of acute painful vasoocclusive crisis characteristic of sickle cell anemia (SCA). We studied 253 patients with acute painful crisis but with no other complications of SCA, randomized to treatment or control groups. In the treatment group, 127 patients received tinzaparin at 175 IU/kg, subcutaneous once daily, along with supportive care including morphine analgesia; in the control group, 126 patients received placebo and the same supportive care. The maximal experimental treatment period was seven days. Analysis revealed a statistically significant reduction in number of days with the severest pain score, overall duration of painful crisis, and duration of hospitalization (p < 0.05 for each comparison of tinzaparin vs. placebo). The decline in pain intensity was sharper for tinzaparin-treated patients, and complications consisted of two minor bleeding events that were reported and treated by cessation of tinzaparin. This investigation demonstrated that tinzaparin, administered at its approved treatment regimen, reduced the severity and duration of acute crisis of SCA.",

"Previous data reported worse outcomes in female patients after acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), related at least in part to less aggressive and nonparallel treatment. We investigated the presence of gender differences in left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function in patients presenting with first STEMI, treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Study population included 187 consecutive patients (81% men) presenting with STEMI and treated by primary PCI and guideline-based medications. Their mean age was 58 Â± 10 years. All patients underwent a comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation within 3 days of admission. Female patients were older (62 Â± 11 vs 59 Â± 10 years, p = 0.006), with more co-morbidities and longer symptom duration (490 Â± 436 vs 365 Â± 437 minutes, p = 0.013). Echocardiography demonstrated that female patients had significantly lower LV systolic function (47 Â± 8% vs 45 Â± 8%, p = 0.03), lower septal and lateral e' velocities, higher average E/e' ratio (all p <0.001), elevated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (p = 0.03), and worse diastolic dysfunction (p = 0.007). No significant changes were present in left atrial volumes. In a logistic multivariate analysis model, female gender emerged as an independent predictor of septal e' <8 cm/s (odds ratio 10.11, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 82.32, p = 0.002) and E/average e' ratio >15 (odds ratio 6.47, 95% confidence interval 1.63 to 25.61, p = 0.008). In conclusion, female patients undergoing primary PCI for first STEMI demonstrated worse systolic and diastolic LV function, despite receiving similar treatment as male patients.",

"To determine what role the technique plays in complications associated with thoracentesis performed by physicians in training, we undertook a prospective study of thoracentesis in the medical service at our institution in which the sampling method was randomized among needle, needle with catheter, and needle with direct sonographic guidance. Fifty-two spontaneously breathing, cooperative patients with free-flowing effusions obliterating more than half of the hemidiaphragm on an upright, posteroanterior chest roentgenogram were randomized. When we analyzed those complications that were potentially life-threatening (eg, pneumothorax) and/or placed patients at increased risk for further morbidity (eg, pneumothorax, dry tap, inadequate tap), the sonography-guided method was associated with significantly fewer serious complications (0 of 19) than the needle-catheter (9 of 18) or needle-only methods (5 of 15). The sonography-guided method was associated with fewer pneumothoraces (0 of 19) than the needle-catheter (7 of 18) or needle-only methods (3 of 15). The difference between needle-catheter and needle-only methods was not significant. From our results, we conclude that the method by which thoracentesis was performed significantly influenced the spectrum and frequency of complications, and the sonography-guided method was the safest.",

"High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) increases and low-frequency rTMS decreases neural excitability. Clinically, rTMS shows beneficial effects in the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, chronic and neuropathic pain has been shown to respond to rTMS treatment. A small pilot study revealed prophylactic effects of high-frequency rTMS in migraine. As there is evidence of neuronal hyperexcitability in migraine, we conducted a placebo-controlled, blinded study to evaluate the therapeutic effects of low-frequency rTMS in migraine. The primary end-point was defined as a reduction of migraine attacks compared with placebo, secondary outcomes were a reduction in the total number of days with headache, hours with headache, pain intensity and a decrease of analgesic intake for migraine. Twenty-seven migraineurs completed the study and were treated with rTMS on five consecutive days. For the verum group, two trains of 500 pulses with a frequency of 1 Hz were applied over vertex with a round coil. For the treatment of the placebo group, a figure-of-eight sham coil was used. A significant decrease of migraine attacks could be observed in the verum group. However, when comparing these effects with placebo, no significance was evident. The same was true concerning secondary outcome measures with regard to days with migraine and total hours with migraine. No effects were evident for pain intensity and use of analgesics. The rTMS treatment was tolerated well. rTMS stimulation over vertex with 1âHz was not effective in migraine prophylaxis when compared with placebo. The positive effects regarding migraine attacks, days and total hours with migraine in the verum group are encouraging and indicate that further research on this topic is warranted.",

"The objective of this study is to analyse our experience in the treatment of refractory chronic migraine (CM) with onabotulinumtoxinA (BTA) and specifically in its effects over disabling attacks. Patients with CM and inadequate response or intolerance to oral preventatives were treated with pericranial injections of 100 U of TBA every 3 months. The dose was increased up to 200 U in case of no response. The patients kept a headache diary. In addition, we specifically asked on the effect of BTA on the frequency of disabling attacks, consumption of triptans and visits to Emergency for the treatment of severe attacks. This series comprises a total of 35 patients (3 males), aged 24-68 years. All except three met IHS criteria for analgesic overuse. The number of sessions with BTA ranged from 2 to 15 (median 4) and nine (26%) responded (reduction of >50% in headache days). However, the frequency of severe attacks was reduced to an average of 46%. Oral triptan consumption (29 patients) was reduced by 50% (from an average of 22 to 11 tablets/month). Those six patients who used subcutaneous sumatriptan reduced its consumption to a mean of 69% (from 4.5 to 1.5 injections per month). Emergency visits went from an average of 3 to 0.4 per trimester (-83%). Six patients complained of mild adverse events, transient local cervical pain being the most common. Although our data must be taken with caution as this is an open trial, in clinical practice treatment of refractory CM with BTA reduces the frequency of disabling attacks, the consumption of triptans and the need of visits to Emergency, which makes this treatment a profitable option both clinically and pharmacoeconomically.",

"Mitral valve (MV) repair using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sutures is an established and preferred interventional method to resolve the complex pathophysiologic problems associated with chordal rupture. We developed a novel computational evaluation protocol to determine the effect of the artificial sutures on restoring MV function following valve repair. A virtual MV was created using three-dimensional echocardiographic data in a patient with ruptured mitral chordae tendineae (RMCT). Virtual repairs were designed by adding artificial sutures between the papillary muscles and the posterior leaflet where the native chordae were ruptured. Dynamic finite element simulations were performed to evaluate pre- and post-repair MV function. Abnormal posterior leaflet prolapse and mitral regurgitation was clearly demonstrated in the MV with ruptured chordae. Following virtual repair to reconstruct ruptured chordae, the severity of the posterior leaflet prolapse decreased and stress concentration was markedly reduced both in the leaflet tissue and the intact native chordae. Complete leaflet coaptation was restored when four or six sutures were utilized. Computational simulations provided quantitative information of functional improvement following MV repair. This novel simulation strategy may provide a powerful tool for evaluation and prediction of interventional treatment for RMCT.",
"Ear acupuncture can be a useful mean for controlling migraine pain. It has been shown that a technique called the Needle Contact Test (NCT) can identify the most efficacious ear acupoints for reducing current migraine pain through just a few seconds of needle contact. The majority of the points were located on the antero-internal part of the antitragus (area M) on the same side of pain. The aim of this study was to verify the therapeutic value of area M and to compare it with an area of the ear (representation of the sciatic nerve, area S) which probably does not have a therapeutic effect on migraine attacks. We studied 94 females suffering from migraine without aura, diagnosed according to the ICHD-II criteria, during the attack. They were randomly subdivided into two groups: in group A, tender points located in area M, positive to NCT were inserted; in group B, the unsuitable area (S) was treated. Changes in pain intensity were measured using a VAS scale at various times of the study. During treatment, there was a highly significant trend in the reduction of the VAS value in group A (Anova for repeated measures: pÂ <Â 0.001), whereas no significance was observed in group B. VAS values were significantly lower in group A than in group B at 10, 30, 60 and 120Â min after needle insertion. This study suggests that the therapeutic specificity of auricular points exists and is linked to the somatotopic representation of our body on the ear.",

The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of topiramate and sodium valproate for the prevention of pediatric migraine, retrospectively. Mean monthly migraine frequency, intensity, and duration in the 28 patients treated with topiramate decreased from 15.3 +/- 10.1 to 4.4 +/- 5.5 episode, from 6.8 +/- 1 to 3.2 +/- 1, and from 10.2 +/- 9.4 to 2.4 +/- 3.1 hours, respectively. Headache disability improved with a reduction of Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment score from 36 +/- 29.5 to 4.6 +/- 6.5 (P < .05). Similarly, mean monthly headache frequency, headache intensity, headache duration, and Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment score in the 20 patients treated with sodium valproate decreased from 20.1 +/- 10.2 to 6.6 +/- 8.6, from 7.1 +/- 1 to 3.4 +/- 2.1, from 7 +/- 12 to 1.4 +/- 2.5 hours, and from 20.5 +/- 16.1 to 5.5 +/- 9.2, respectively (P < .05). In conclusion, valproate and topiramate seem to be able to manage successfully childhood migraine without substantial differences in efficacy.",

Aortic dilatation progresses equally fast in BAV (tubular segment) and MFS (Valsalva sinuses), but a significantly higher proportion of BAV patients does not progress at all, irrespective of BAV type. Baseline aortic diameter does not proportionally predict progression rate; systematic follow-up is therefore warranted in patients with BAV.",

"Several factors contribute to the risk of percutaneous coronary intervention-related major entry site (MES) complications. We sought to examine the trends in MES among unselected patients during the stent era. Data from the Dynamic Registry including 5 distinct recruitment waves from 1997 to 2006 (n = 10,932) were used to assess baseline characteristics and MES among consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. MES was defined as bleeding requiring transfusion, pseudoaneurysm, arterial thrombosis or dissection, vascular complication requiring surgery, or retroperitoneal bleed. Uncomplicated hematomas were not included. Several trends were observed in baseline characteristics including an increase from wave 1 to wave 5 in body mass index >30 kg/m(2) (30.2% to 40.4%), renal disease (3.5% to 9.1%), diabetes (28.0% to 34.1%), and hypertension (59.4% to 78%; ptrend <0.001 for all). The use of a thienopyridine increased significantly from wave 1 (49.7%) to wave 5 (84%), whereas glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor use peaked in wave 3 (53.1%) and then decreased (p <0.001). Access site was predominately femoral, but radial access increased over time (0.3% wave 1, 6.6% wave 5, p â¤0.0001). The rates of MES (2.8% to 2.2%, ptrend = 0.01) and MES requiring transfusion (2.0% to 0.74%, ptrend <0.001) were low and decreased with time. The trend in less risk for MES in later time periods remained after adjustment. In conclusion, MES has decreased over time; however, opportunity for bleeding avoidance strategies still exists.",

"Despite the clear public health benefit of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), the impact of malaria transmission-reduction by vector control on the spread of drug resistance is not well understood. In the present study, the effect of sustained transmission reduction by ITNs on the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum gene mutations associated with resistance to the antimalarial drugs sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and chloroquine (CQ) in children under the age of five years was investigated during an ITN trial in Asembo area, western Kenya. During the ITN trial, the national first line antimalarial treatment changed from CQ to SP. Smear-positive samples collected from cross sectional surveys prior to ITN introduction (baseline, nâ=â250) and five years post-ITN intervention (year 5 survey, nâ=â242) were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at dhfr-51, 59, 108, 164 and dhps-437, 540 (SP resistance), and pfcrt-76 and pfmdr1-86 (CQ resistance). The association between the drug resistance mutations and epidemiological variables was evaluated. There were significant increases in the prevalence of SP dhps mutations and the dhfr/dhps quintuple mutant, and a significant reduction in the proportion of mixed infections detected at dhfr-51, 59 and dhps-437, 540 SNPs from baseline to the year 5 survey. There was no change in the high prevalence of pfcrt-76 and pfmdr1-86 mutations. Multivariable regression analysis further showed that current antifolate use and year of survey were significantly associated with more SP drug resistance mutations. These results suggest that increased antifolate drug use due to drug policy change likely led to the high prevalence of SP mutations 5 years post-ITN intervention and reduced transmission had no apparent effect on the existing high prevalence of CQ mutations. There is no evidence from the current study that sustained transmission reduction by ITNs reduces the prevalence of genes associated with malaria drug resistance.",
"Study the serum level of HGF, Cys C and TGF-beta1 in type 2 diabetic nephropathy (DN), the infect of Pingshen decoction on those index. Selected 69 cases of 2 type DN and randomly divided into therapy group (36 cases) and control group (33 cases). The therapy group were treated with Pingshen decoction 1 dose/d, bid po. The control group were treated with NephritisShu tablet, 6 tablet, tid po. 8 weeks was a course. Before and after treatment, we examine the serum level of HGF, Cys C and TGF-beta1 by ELISA and immunonephelometry, and compare with 30 cases of healthy control group. The study demonstrates that before treatment, the serum level of HGF in both groups were significantly lower than healthy control group (P < 0.01), but Cys C, TGF-beta1 were significantly higher (P < 0.01). After treatment, the serum level of HGF of both groups were increased. The serum level of HGF of therapy group were significantly higher than of control group (P < 0.01), but the serum level of Cys C and TGF-beta1 were significantly lower than control group (P < 0.01). The serum level of HGF was correlated negatively with Cys C,TGF-beta1. In control group, the UAER, urine beta2-MG and quantity of 24-hour urine protein were significantly decreased after treatment (P < 0.01). The index of urine of therapy group were significantly lower than control group (P < 0.01). Results indicate that test of serum level of HGF and Cys C,TGF-beta1 of diabetic nephropathy have important clinical significance. Pingshen decoction can effectively intervene in the serum level of HGF and Cys C, TGF-beta1 and index of urine.",

"Estimates and projections of diagnosed incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the United States have been highly inconsistent across published studies. Although it is generally acknowledged that AF incidence and prevalence are increasing due to growing numbers of older people in the U.S. population, estimates of the rate of expected growth have varied widely. Reasons for these variations include differences in study design, covered time period, birth cohort, and temporal effects, as well as improvements in AF diagnosis due to increased use of diagnostic tools and health care awareness. The objective of this study was to estimate and project the incidence and prevalence of diagnosed AF in the United States out to 2030. A large health insurance claims database for the years 2001 to 2008, representing a geographically diverse 5% of the U.S. population, was used in this study. The trend and growth rate in AF incidence and prevalence was projected by a dynamic age-period cohort simulation progression model that included all diagnosed AF cases in future prevalence projections regardless of follow-up treatment, as well as those cases expected to be chronic in nature. Results from the model showed that AF incidence will double, from 1.2 million cases in 2010 to 2.6 million cases in 2030. Given this increase in incidence, AF prevalence is projected to increase from 5.2 million in 2010 to 12.1 million cases in 2030. The effect of uncertainty in model parameters was explored in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Variability in future trends in AF incidence and recurrence rates has the greatest impact on the projected estimates of chronic AF prevalence. It can be concluded that both incidence and prevalence of AF are likely to rise from 2010 to 2030, but there exists a wide range of uncertainty around the magnitude of future trends.",

"Thrombocytopenia is commonly seen in Plasmodium vivax malaria, but its prognostic value has not been addressed in children. This prospective study included 676 admitted children of malaria [Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) monoinfection 262, Plasmodium vivax (Pv) monoinfection 380, and mixed (Pfâ+âPv) infection 34], in which thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150âÃâ10(3)/mm(3) on admission) was found in 442 (65.38%) children [Pf monoinfection 55.3% (145/262), Pv monoinfection 73.16% (278/380), and mixed infection 55.88% (19/34)]. The association of thrombocytopenia was statistically significant with Pv monoinfection [73.16% (278/380)] in comparison to either Pf monoinfection [55.34% (145/262); odds ratio (OR)â=â2.199 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.577-3.068), pâ<â0.0001] or mixed infection [55.88% (19/34); ORâ=â2.152 (95%CI 1.054-4.394), pâ=â0.032]. In Pv monoinfection, thrombocytopenia was highest in 0-5 years age group and subsequently decreased with advancing age, whereas in Pf monoinfection it was reverse. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20âÃâ10(3)/mm(3)) was present in 16.52% (73/442) children [Pv monoinfection 21.58% (60/278) and Pf monoinfection 8.97% (13/145)]. The risk of developing severe thrombocytopenia was also highest in Pv monoinfection [15.79% (60/380)] in comparison to Pf monoinfection [10.59% (13/262); ORâ=â3.591 (95%CI 1.928-6.690), pâ<â0.0001]. Bleeding manifestations were associated in 21.27% (94/442) children [Pf monoinfection 9.92% (26/262), Pv monoinfection 16.58% (63/380), and mixed malaria 14.71% (5/34)]. All the children having bleeding manifestations had thrombocytopenia but low platelet counts were not always associated with abnormal bleeding. The association of severe malaria was significantly more among children having Pv monoinfection with platelet counts <20âÃâ10(3)/mm(3) [ORâ=â2.569 (95%CI 1.196-5.517), pâ<â0.014] with specificity of 88.3% and positive predictive value of 85%.

"To investigate the frequency of pheochromocytoma in patients with incidentally discovered adrenal masses (incidentalomas) and to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of the Glucagon test in comparison with resting plasma catecholamines, 89 patients with adrenal incidentalomas (age range 23-80 yr; 41 males and 48 females) were studied. Fifty-seven patients were normotensive (SBP 130+/-1.8 mmHg; DBP 80+/-0.7 mmHg, mean+/-SE) and 32 had stable hypertension (SBP 155+/-3.3 mmHg, DBP 93+/-1.4 mmHg): no patient complained of typical signs or symptoms of pheochromocytoma. Resting plasma samples for noradrenaline and adrenaline determination and, at appropriate intervals, the Glucagon test (1 mg i.v.), were performed in all subjects. Diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was made on the basis of humoral evaluations and/or surgical intervention in 6 patients (6.7%), of whom 3 hypertensives and 3 normotensives. Resting plasma catecholamines revealed 5 out of 6 patients with pheochromocytoma: in 3 cases both catecholamines were above the normal range, in 1 only adrenaline was elevated and in 1 case only noradrenaline. Similarily, the glucagon test identified 5/6 pheochromocytomas: in 3 patients the response was abnormal for both catecholamines, in 1 only for adrenaline and in 1 case only for noradrenaline. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of resting plasma catecholamines and of the glucagon test were comparable: 83.3%, 96.3%, and 95.5%, respectively. In conclusion, the frequency of pheochromocytoma in adrenal incidentalomas is not negligible, and since the diagnostic accuracy of the Glucagon test is the same of that of resting plasma catecholamines, the former does not appear to offer additional advantages in the diagnosis of incidentally discovered pheochromocytomas.",

"Sequence diversity in pathogen antigens is an obstacle to the development of interventions against many infectious diseases. In malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, the PfEMP1 family of variant surface antigens encoded by var genes are adhesion molecules that play a pivotal role in malaria pathogenesis and clinical disease. PfEMP1 is a major target of protective immunity, however, development of drugs or vaccines based on PfEMP1 is problematic due to extensive sequence diversity within the PfEMP1 family. Here we identified the PfEMP1 variants transcribed by P. falciparum strains selected for a virulence-associated adhesion phenotype (IgM-positive rosetting). The parasites transcribed a subset of Group A PfEMP1 variants characterised by an unusual PfEMP1 architecture and a distinct N-terminal domain (either DBLÎ±1.5 or DBLÎ±1.8 type). Antibodies raised in rabbits against the N-terminal domains showed functional activity (surface reactivity with live infected erythrocytes (IEs), rosette inhibition and induction of phagocytosis of IEs) down to low concentrations (<10 Âµg/ml of total IgG) against homologous parasites. Furthermore, the antibodies showed broad cross-reactivity against heterologous parasite strains with the same rosetting phenotype, including clinical isolates from four sub-Saharan African countries that showed surface reactivity with either DBLÎ±1.5 antibodies (variant HB3var6) or DBLÎ±1.8 antibodies (variant TM284var1). These data show that parasites with a virulence-associated adhesion phenotype share IE surface epitopes that can be targeted by strain-transcending antibodies to PfEMP1. The existence of shared surface epitopes amongst functionally similar disease-associated P. falciparum parasite isolates suggests that development of therapeutic interventions to prevent severe malaria is a realistic goal.",
"LAViÂ â¥32 ml/m(2) was found in 105 patients (34%). During follow-up, 60 patients (20%) experienced the composite endpoint, of whom 28 (9%) died. Patients with LAViÂ â¥32 ml/m(2) had a significantly higher cardiac event rate and death rate (pÂ < 0.001 and pÂ = 0.002, respectively). Univariate predictors of the composite endpoint were age, hypertension, left ventricular diastolic function, E/e'septum-ratio and LAViÂ â¥32 ml/m(2); however, myocardial ischemia on MPS was not a predictor. When adjusting for age and hypertension, only LAViÂ â¥32 ml/m(2) was a predictor of the composite endpoint (hazard ratio: 1.82 [95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 3.07], pÂ = 0.024).",

"The Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to test whether hydroxyurea can reduce the rate of painful crises in adult patients who have at least three painful crises per year. The sample size of 299 patients yields at least 90% power to detect a 50% or greater reduction in crisis rate. Dosage starts at 15 mg/kg/day and is titrated to the patient's maximum tolerated dose up to 35 mg/kg/day. Placebo dosage is titrated in similar fashion to maintain blinding. Attempts are made to ascertain medical contacts for at least 2 years after study entry. The Core Laboratory, Treatment Distribution Center, and Data Coordinating Center collaborate to provide standardized monitoring for toxicity and dose adjustments. The Core Laboratory also reduces the possibility of inadvertent unmasking of treatment assignment during review of hematologic data in clinical centers. An independent Crisis Review Committee classifies clinical events to assure that outcome evaluations are standardized and unbiased by knowledge of treatment assignments. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board assures scientific integrity of the study, as well as the safety and ethical treatment of study patients. We expect the study to determine whether or not treatment with hydroxyurea can offer significant clinical benefit to patients with the most common hereditary disorder among African-Americans in the United States.",
"Recently, we reported that angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), valsartan, and calcium channel blocker (CCB), amlodipine, had similar effects on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in diabetic hypertensive patients. We assessed the difference of cardiovascular protective effects between ARB and CCB in patients with and without previous CVD, respectively. A total of 1,150 Japanese diabetic hypertensive patients were randomized to either valsartan or amlodipine treatment arms, which were additionally divided into 2 groups according to the presence of previous CVD at baseline (without CVD, nÂ = 818; with CVD, nÂ = 332). The primary composite outcomes were sudden cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure. The incidence of primary end point events in patients with previous CVD was 3.5-times greater than that in patients without previous CVD (64.1 vs 17.9/1,000 person-years). The ARB- and the CCB-based treatment arms showed similar incidence of composite CVD events in both patients without previous CVD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 2.40) and those with previous CVD (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.31). The ARB-treatment arm showed less incidence of stroke compared with the CCB-based treatment arm in patients with previous CVD (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.11, pÂ = 0.068), whereas the 2 treatment arms showed similar incidence of stroke in patients without previous CVD (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.91). In conclusion, the ARB- and the CCB-based treatments exerted similar protective effects of CVD events regardless of the presence of previous CVD. For stroke events, the ARB may have more protective effects than the CCB in diabetic hypertensive patients with previous CVD.",
"Objective of the study was assessment of the usefulness of determination of noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) in urine and blood as well as the total methoxycatecholamines (MNA +MA), vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), DOPA and dopamine (DA) urinary excretion in diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. The experience based on 155 patients with pheochromocytoma (105F, 50M, age 18-82 yrs) diagnosed in the Department of Hypertension and Angiology Academy of Medicine in Warsaw will be discussed. In all patients excluding 2 cases pheochromocytoma has been proven histopathologically. The most considerable diagnostic usefulness of MNA + MA indication was proven. MNA + MA was increased in 96.6 patients. In 89.6% patients an increased excretion of NA and A or one of this catecholamines was demonstrated. An increased excretion of VMA was demonstrated in 75%. The excretion of DOPA and dopamine was tested in 120 cases. An increased excretion of DA was shown in 31% and DOPA in 16%.",

"Bedaquiline is a new antituberculosis agent targeting ATP synthase. This randomized, double-blinded study enrolling 68 sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients evaluated the 14-day early bactericidal activity of daily doses of 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, and 400 mg bedaquiline, preceded by loading doses of 200 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, and 700 mg, respectively, on the first treatment day and 100 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, and 500 mg on the second treatment day. All groups showed activity with a mean (standard deviation) daily fall in log10 CFU over 14 days of 0.040 (0.068), 0.056 (0.051), 0.077 (0.064), and 0.104 (0.077) in the 100-mg, 200-mg, 300-mg, and 400-mg groups, respectively. The linear trend for dose was significant (P = 0.001), and activity in the 400-mg dose group was greater than that in the 100-mg group (P = 0.014). All of the bedaquiline groups showed significant bactericidal activity that was continued to the end of the 14-day evaluation period. The finding of a linear trend for dose suggests that the highest dose compatible with safety considerations should be taken forward to longer-term clinical studies.",
"A total of 661 patients were enrolled and were followed for a median of 25 months.

"There was significant geographical variation in aspirin dosing, with North American patients receiving high-dose aspirin more frequently than other countries (66% vs. 28%; pÂ < 0.001). Clinical factors correlating with high-doseÂ aspirin included previous percutaneous coronary intervention and use of aspirin before randomization.

"Genotypes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) are related to the geographic origin of the patients and population migration. The relationship between genotypes of MTB and clinical presentations has mainly focused on transmission of multi-drug resistant MTB strain in population. This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology and dynamic change of MTB genotypes in Taiwan, and their association with clinical presentation among patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. A multi-center, two-year study which enrolled 516 patients with 516 MTB isolates was conducted, including: (1) 254 isolates from northern Taiwan; (2) 38 isolates from mid-western Taiwan; (3) 211 isolates from southern Taiwan; and (4) 13 isolates from the east coast of Taiwan. The isolates were genotyped with spoligotyping and standardized 12-loci-MIRU-VNTR method. The results showed Beijing/Beijing-like family was the major genotype of MTB in the northern (58%), eastern (53%), and southern (33%) regions. The second most widely spread lineage were the EAI-Manila (20% in the west and south) and Haarlem family (13-27% in the south, west, and east). According to the cluster analysis of 12-MIRU-VNTR genotypes, there were differences in distribution of MTB genotype between the northern and southern regions, and a temporal relationship between isolation year and 12-MIRU-VNTR genotype especially in loci 26 and 39 might exist. Furthermore, some patients with cavity lesions on chest films were associated with a cluster of Beijing family MTB strains, which can be defined by cluster analysis of 12-MIRU-VNTR genotype. However, the results of 12-loci-MIRU-VNTR genotyping in a longitudinal study should be interpreted with caution due to its short term instability. Further investigations of different molecular methodologies are necessary.",

"VAP-1 (vascular adhesion protein-1) possesses semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) activity. It has also been found that serum VAP-1 was elevated in acute and chronic hyperglycemia and in patients with diabetes as well as in chronic kidney disease. Renalase, with possible monoamine oxidase activity, which breaks down catecholamines such as SSAO, is expressed in the endothelium as well as in the kidney. The aim of the study was to assess serum VAP-1 levels in peritoneally dialyzed (PD) patients and factors explaining its variability. This pilot study was performed on 25 peritoneally dialyzed patients, including 4 patients with type 2 diabetes. We found that the mean VAP-1 was significantly higher in chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients when compared to the control group (p<0.05). Dopamine was significantly lower in PD patients when compared to the healthy volunteers (p<0.05), whereas noradrenaline was significantly higher in PD patients relative to the healthy volunteers (p<0.01). There was a significant difference in the VAP-1 concentration in the group with and without residual renal function (p<0.05) as well as between 10 patients with hyperglycemia when compared to patients with normoglycemia (p<0.05). There was no effect of gender on the serum VAP-1 levels. In PD patients VAP-1 correlated with systolic blood pressure (r=-0.4, p<005), residual renal function (r=-0.62, p<0.05), and glucose (=0.54, p<0.05). We concluded that VAP-1, elevated in patients on PD, was predominantly dependent on residual kidney function and glucose level, factors both linked to endothelial damage and cardiovascular complications.",

"The current study is designed to compare the effectiveness of brushing the pleura vs. instillation of minocycline for the management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, and to assess the sensitivity of echography in defining areas of defects. Blebectomy and pleurodesis were carried out thoracoscopically on 84 patients. In group A (42 patients), abrasions were induced using a sponge on a long ring forceps. Group B (42 patients) received intrapleural instillation of minocycline. Echography was carried out two weeks after discharge and then repeated two weeks later. Follow-up ranged between 28 and 39 months. Two patients were excluded from group A for incomplete follow-up. In group A, five patients (12%) showed areas of free mobility of the lung on first echography. At the second examination, three (7% of the total) showed the same areas of mobility; one patient developed an attack of localized pneumothorax after 32 and another after 45 weeks. Each had three adjacent areas of free mobility. In group B, two patients each showed one area of free mobility on the first and second examinations but no recurrence during follow-up. The two groups had comparable chest drainage, postoperative hospital stay and complication rates. The patients in group B demonstrated a trend towards a decreased rate of prolonged air leaks (2% vs. 5%; P=0.100). Thus, pleurodesis by instillation of minocycline as a part of thoracoscopy is more effective than brushing the pleura. Thoracic echography is a highly sensitive method for assessing the effectiveness of pleurodesis.",
"An open label, multi-center, 6 months observational study of new fixed combination (travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5%), in order to evaluate both efficacy (intraocular pressure lowering) and tolerability (patient and investigator satisfaction) of two dosing regimens--evening (PM) and morning (AM). After screening for enrollment, to 40 patients (79 eyes with primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension), new fixed combination travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% was prescribed once a day in the evening (PM). Patients were enrolled according to each investigator decision on indication for travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination once a day, without washout period after previous medication. Intraocular pressure was measured at 9 AM at all time control points: at baseline, after 1 month, after 3 months and after 6 month. After 1 month, screening for nonresponders (criteria: 20% intraocular pressure lowering) and subjects with major side effects was performed. At second control visit, after 3 months PM dosing, intraocular pressure was measured and patients were instructed to continue once a day the same medication, but in the morning (AM) for consequent 3 months. After 1 month, reduction in mean intraocular pressure value was 21.66%. At the visit after 3 month, the mean intraocular pressure was 15.67 +/- 2.17 mm Hg (reduction 21.14%). 3 month after dosing regimen changed to AM (6 month after beginning of travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% combination therapy), reduction in intraocular pressure value was 19.86%. The differences (mean +/- standard deviation) in intraocular pressure values after 1, 3 and 6 month were all highly statistically significant compared to baseline values. The tolerability was evaluated in five steps (Likert scale) ranging from unsatisfactory to excellent by both patient and investigator--taken at 3 and 6 month control visit. 95% of patients and 100% of investigators were satisfied with the possibility of choosing dosing regimen for travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination. Travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination proved sufficient intraocular pressure control dosed either PM or AM with no statistically significant difference between two dosing regimens. Possibility to choose between two dosing regimens gives each practitioner additional reassurance that glaucoma therapy will be individualised to needs of each patient.",
"Recent evidence has shown that endocrine tumors are under an endocrine and an immune regulation, and that biotherapies with interferon or the long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide may be effective in the control of tumor growth and clinical symptomatology. Within the biotherapies of tumors, interleukin-2(IL-2) has appeared to play an essential role in the antitumor immune response. Despite its important antitumor role, very few studies have been carried out to investigate the possible use of IL-2 in the treatment of advanced endocrine tumors. Its potential toxicity would represent the main limiting factor for the clinical experiments with IL-2. Our previous studies have shown that the pineal hormone melatonin (MLT) may amplify the antitumor activity of IL-2, either through immunomodulating mechanisms or through a direct cytostatic activity by inhibiting tumor growth factor production. On this basis, we have performed a phase II pilot study with low-dose IL-2 plus MLT in 14 patients with untreatable endocrine tumors because of disseminated disease, lack of response to previous standard biotherapies or chemotherapies, or tumors for whom no effective therapy is available. Thyroid cancers, carcinoid and endodrine pancreatic tumors were the most frequent neoplasms. IL-2 was given at 3 million IU/day s.c. at 8 p.m. for 6 days/week for 4 weeks, corresponding to one cycle. MLT was given orally at 40 mg/day at 8 p.m. every day. In nonprogressed patients, a second cycle was given after a 21-day rest period. Patients were considered as evaluable when they received at least one complete cycle, and 12 patients were fully evaluable. According to WHO criteria, a partial response was achieved in 3/12 (25%) patients (carcinoid tumor: 1; neuroendocrine lung tumor: 1; pancreatic islet cell tumor: 1). Another patient with gastrinoma had a more than 50% reduction of tumor markers. Toxicity was low in all patients. This preliminary study suggests that low-dose IL-2 immunotherapy in association with the pineal hormone MLT may constitute a new well-tolerated and potentially active therapy of untreatable advanced endocrine tumors.",

"The aim of study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of alpha, beta-arteether injection 150 mg/ml by performing a phase III, multicentre, open label, and single treatment study in patients with P falciparum malaria. A total of 145 patients with P falciparum malaria were screened to achieve patient pool of 101 subjects based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, from which 100 patients completed the study successfully. Mean cure rate was calculated as primary efficacy parameter, while mean parasite clearance time (hours) and mean fever clearance time (hours) were calculated as secondary efficacy parameters, to evaluate efficacy of alpha, beta-arteether injection 150 mg/ml. Safety evaluation was measured by observing and monitoring adverse events, clinical examination, assessment of vitals and haematology laboratory parameters. Statistical analysis was performed with 5% level of significance. Mean cure rate, mean parasite clearance time (hours) and mean fever clearance time (hours) were 99.01%, 24.72 +/- 0.41 hours and 46.86 +/- 0.97 hours respectively. A total of 6 patients were observed with pain at injection site out of 101 enrolled patients. There were no clinically significant vitals and haematology changes. There were no abnormal posttreatment values observed. The study confirmed that alpha, gamma-arteether injection 150 mg/ml is highly effective in treatment of P falciparum malaria.",

"Dairy products have previously been reported to be associated with beneficial effects on body weight and metabolic risk markers. Moreover, primary data from the Diet, Obesity and Genes (DiOGenes) study indicate a weight-maintaining effect of a high-protein-low-glycaemic index diet. The objective of the present study was to examine putative associations between consumption of dairy proteins and changes in body weight and metabolic risk markers after weight loss in obese and overweight adults. Results were based on secondary analyses of data obtained from overweight and obese adults who completed the DiOGenes study. The study consisted of an 8-week weight-loss phase and a 6-month weight-maintenance (WM) phase, where the subjects were given five different diets varying in protein content and glycaemic index. In the present study, data obtained from all the subjects were pooled. Dairy protein intake was estimated from 3 d dietary records at two time points (week 4 and week 26) during the WM phase. Body weight and metabolic risk markers were determined at baseline (week -9 to -11) and before and at the end of the WM phase (week 0 and week 26). Overall, no significant associations were found between consumption of dairy proteins and changes in body weight and metabolic risk markers. However, dairy protein intake tended to be negatively associated with body weight gain (P=0Â·08; Î²=-0Â·17), but this was not persistent when controlled for total protein intake, which indicates that dairy protein adds no additional effect to the effect of total protein. Therefore, the present study does not report that dairy proteins are more favourable than other proteins for body weight regulation.",

"We studied the effects of rapamycin on cultures of erythroid progenitors derived from the peripheral blood of 10 beta-thalassaemia patients differing widely with respect to their potential to produce foetal haemoglobin (HbF). For this, we employed the two-phase liquid culture procedure for growing erythroid progenitors, high performance liquid chromatography for analysis of HbF production and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for quantification of the accumulation of globin mRNAs. The results demonstrated that rapamycin induced an increase of HbF in cultures from all the beta-thalassaemia patients studied and an increase of their overall Hb content/cell. The inducing effect of rapamycin was restricted to gamma-globin mRNA accumulation, being only minor for beta-globin and none for alpha-globin mRNAs. The ability of rapamycin to preferentially increase gamma-globin mRNA content and production of HbF in erythroid precursor cells from beta-thalassaemia patients is of great importance as this agent (also known as sirolimus or rapamune) is already in clinical use as an anti-rejection agent following kidney transplantation.

"Overcoming antigenic variation is one of the major challenges in the development of an effective vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum, a causative agent of human malaria. Inclusion of multiple Ag variants in subunit vaccine candidates is one strategy that has aimed to overcome this problem for the leading blood-stage malaria vaccine targets, that is, merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) and apical membrane Ag 1 (AMA1). However, previous studies, utilizing malaria Ags, have concluded that inclusion of multiple allelic variants, encoding altered peptide ligands, in such a vaccine may be detrimental to both the priming and in vivo restimulation of Ag-experienced T cells. In this study, we analyze the T cell responses to two alleles of MSP1 and AMA1 induced by vaccination of malaria-naive adult volunteers with bivalent viral-vectored vaccine candidates. We show a significant bias to the 3D7/MAD20 allele compared with the Wellcome allele for the 33 kDa region of MSP1, but not for the 19 kDa fragment or the AMA1 Ag. Although this bias could be caused by "immune interference" at priming, the data do not support a significant role for "immune antagonism" during memory T cell restimulation, despite observation of the latter at a minimal epitope level in vitro. A lack of class I HLA epitopes in the Wellcome allele that are recognized by vaccinated volunteers may in fact contribute to the observed bias. We also show that controlled infection with 3D7 strain P. falciparum parasites neither boosts existing 3D7-specific T cell responses nor appears to "immune divert" cellular responses toward the Wellcome allele.",

We found a significant difference in sensitivity of different tests, acid fast bacilli were detected in 17 (16.6%) samples by ZN Staining , 47 (46.1%) by BACTEC culture and using IS6110 PCR, 62 (60.7%) were positive for IS6110 PCR for M. tuberculosis. We found IS6110 PCR was much more sensitive than ZN staining and BACTEC culture. IS6110 PCR detection of M. tuberculosis may be very useful in cases that are highly suspect as pleural tuberculosis and those that are negative for AFB and culture. IS6110 PCR may gain an immense prospective to better clinicians ability to improve diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis.",
"Corneal endothelial morphology showed a significant reduction of CD under therapy with BB compared to the no-treatment group. As this was not found on comparing individual medications, it could be a statistical phenomenon of larger counts and thus of secondary clinical concern.

In addition the study demonstrated the mobilisation of asexual parasites from the deep to the periphery in the early hours of commencing ACT treatment in a subset of patients in both study groups. It is unclear whether the early parasite dynamics discovered in this study play any role in the development of drug resistance and thus it is important to further evaluate this discovery. It may be useful for studies investigating delay in parasite clearance of artemisinin derivatives as a way of monitoring the development of resistance to artemisinin to assess the early effects of the drugs on the parasites.",

"This study was aimed at probing the effects of intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy with simvastatin on the large artery elasticity of acute myocardial infarction patients. A total of 72 cases of acute myocardial infarction patients were divided into a normocholesterol group (n = 37) and a hypercholesterol group (n = 35) according to their serum low-density lipoprotein. All patients were given oral simvastatin 40 mg/day for 6 months, and their pulse-wave velocity (PWV) of different artery segments and ankle-brachial index (ABI) were measured before and after the therapy. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in both groups decreased significantly (2.13 +/- 0.32 vs 1.56 +/- 0.28, 3.43 +/- 0.80 vs 2.28 +/- 0.47 mmol/l, P < 0.01). The PWV of each artery segment in both the normocholesterol group and the hypercholesterol group decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Pulse-wave velocity in the hypercholesterol group was lowered much more than that of the normocholesterol group (P < 0.05). There were no differences among each artery segment in each group. Ankle-brachial index increased significantly in both groups (1.12 +/- 0.16 to 1.22 +/- 0.12, P < 0.05 in the normocholesterol group, and 1.03 +/- 0.22 to 1.23 +/- 0.16, P < 0.01 in the hypercholesterol group), but ABI increased much more in the hypercholesterol group than in the normocholesterol group (0.21 + 0.15 vs 0.11 + 0.09 P = 0.02). Intensive cholesterol-lowering therapy with simvastatin for acute myocardial infarction patients can significantly improve their large artery elasticity and regress their atherosclerosis. Hypercholesterol patients benefit more from this therapy.",

"Through bound apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase, inducing vasodilation. Because patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have low apoA-I and endothelial dysfunction, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to test whether extended-release niacin (niacin-ER) increases apoA-I-containing HDL-C and improves vascular function in SCD. Twenty-seven patients with SCD with levels of HDL-C <39 mg/dl or apoA-I <99 mg/dl were randomized to 12 weeks of niacin-ER, increased in 500-mg increments to a maximum of 1,500 mg/day, or placebo. The primary outcome was the absolute change in HDL-C level after 12 weeks, with endothelial function assessed before and at the end of treatment. Niacin-ER-treated patients trended to greater increase in HDL-C level compared with placebo treatment at 12 weeks (5.1 Â± 7.7 vs 0.9 Â± 3.8 mg/dl, 1-tailed p = 0.07), associated with significantly greater improvements in the ratios of low-density lipoprotein to HDL-C levels (1.24 vs 1.95, p = 0.003) and apolipoprotein B to apoA-I levels (0.46 vs 0.58, p = 0.03) compared with placebo-treated patients. No improvements were detected in 3 independent vascular physiology assays of endothelial function. Thus, the relatively small changes in HDL-C levels achieved by the dose of niacin-ER used in our study are not associated with improved vascular function in patients with SCD with initially low levels of apoA-I or HDL-C.",

"Cardiovascular disease has emerged as a crescent problem among HIV-infected population. This study aimed to determine the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease using the Framingham risk score among HIV-infected patients from three regions of Brazil. This is a pooled analysis of three cohort studies, which enrolled 3,829 individuals, 59% were men, 66% had white skin color, and mean age 39.0 Â± 9.9 years. Comparisons among regions showed that there were marked differences in demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and HIV-related characteristics. Prevalence of Framingham score â¥10 was 4.5% in the Southern, 4.2% in the Midwest, and 3.9% in the Northeast of Brazil. The Framingham score â¥10 was similar between regions for males, patients aged â¥60 years, with obesity, central obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Women were three times more likely to have coronary heart disease in 10 years than men. Hypertension and diabetes increased more than four times the risk of coronary heart disease, followed by central obesity, obesity, and prehypertension. The use of antiretroviral agents and time since HIV diagnosis were not risk factors for coronary artery disease in 10 years. In conclusion, hypertension and diabetes are the strongest independent predictors of 10-year risk of coronary heart disease among HIV-infected population.",

"To evaluate whether opioid receptor blockade might modulate sympathetic-adrenal activity, we studied the effects of placebo or naloxone administration on plasma catecholamine (CA) levels in a group of 13 normal subjects and 15 hypertensive patients suspected to have a pheochromocytoma. Diagnostic evaluation confirmed the presence of pheochromocytoma in 9 patients. Among these, 4 had a unilateral epinephrine (E)-secreting tumor, 3 had bilateral E-secreting tumors due to multiple endocrine adenomatosis type IIa, and 2 had a unilateral norepinephrine (NE)-secreting tumor. In each subject studied, CA secretion was evaluated by calculating the area (0-30 min) under the plasma hormone curves after placebo or naloxone administration. In normal subjects naloxone caused a significant increase (P less than 0.005) of E secretion, whereas NE did not change. Similarly, in the group of hypertensive patients, E secretion increased after naloxone (P less than 0.01). In pheochromocytoma patients naloxone caused a significant increase in E (P less than 0.05) and NE (P less than 0.01) secretion from E-producing tumors but no increase in the patients with NE-secreting pheochromocytomas. The study suggests that CA secretion from normal and pathological chromaffin tissue is modulated by endogenous opioids; this modulation seems particularly evident in patients with E-secreting pheochromocytoma.",

"Cangrelor is an intravenous P2Y12 inhibitor under investigation as an antiplatelet drug in the setting of acute coronary syndromes. To determine the electrophysiologic safety of parenteral cangrelor, cardiac repolarization effects were measured in 67 healthy volunteers (aged 18-45 years) in a randomized crossover design, including 4 treatment sequences of therapeutic cangrelor, supratherapeutic cangrelor, placebo, and moxifloxacin (positive control). Triplicate electrocardiogram measurements and pharmacokinetic samples were collected at baseline and 9 time points postdose on day 1. For both cangrelor and moxifloxacin, time-matched, placebo-adjusted change in QT from baseline was evaluated using an individual (QTcI) heart rate correction. After cangrelor dosing, change in QTcI was <5 ms at all times points and all corresponding upper 2-sided 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were <10 ms. Although moxifloxacin failed to show a lower CI >5 ms, expected time trends and lower CI >4.0 ms demonstrate assay sensitivity. QTcI was not affected by plasma concentrations of cangrelor metabolites, and cangrelor had no other adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters. Clinically, cangrelor exposure was well tolerated. Thus, this thorough QT study demonstrated that therapeutic and supratherapeutic cangrelor doses do not adversely affect cardiac repolarization in normal volunteers (clinicaltrials.gov; identifier NCT00699504).",

The study included 40 patients (80 eyes) with open angle glaucoma and intraocular pressure (IOP) above 18 mm Hg treated with topical beta blocker (timolol 0.50% twice a day). Travoprost 0.004% was added to timolol 0.5% therapy once daily in the evening. Follow up examinations were scheduled at 7 days, one month and three months. IOP lowering was achieved in all patients. Substantial lowering of 2.42 mm Hg was achieved after the first week of treatment. Further lowering and stabilization of IOP was recorded at three months, with total IOP decrease of 3.97 mm Hg; the difference was statistically significant (chi2=6.7743; p<0.01). At three months, target IOP was recorded in 64 eyes (16.4+/-0.7 mm Hg) and failed to be achieved in 16 eyes (21.1+/-2.3 mm Hg). Mild hyperemia was found in two patients and discrete hyperemia in 26 patients. Burning sensation associated with the use of travoprost 0.004% eye drops was reported by 68 patients.

"We hypothesized that the response to cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) in patients with mildly symptomatic heart failure (HF) is more favorable than the commonly referenced figure of 70%. This study involves the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT) study population in which paired echocardiograms from baseline and 1-year follow-up were available in 621 implantable cardioverter-defibrillator-treated patients and 749 patients treated with CRT-D. We prespecified CRT-D responders as the patients who at 1-year follow-up had a reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) that corresponded to the top (best) quintile of LVESV reduction in the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator-treated patients, that is, a â¥17% reduction in LVESV. Using this metric, 88% of patients treated with CRT-D and 91% of the patients treated with CRT-D with left bundle branch block (LBBB) were identified as cardiac resynchronization therapy responders. Landmark multivariate Cox model analyses revealed a significant interaction (p=0.038) involving LVESV (responders vs nonresponders) and LBBB (present vs not present) in risk reduction for HF or death. The interaction finding indicates that cardiac resynchronization therapy responders with LBBB have a significantly lower risk for HF or death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.24) than patients without LBBB (HR 0.62). In the patients treated with CRT-D, LVESV response was associated with reduction in the risk of death (HR 0.20, p<0.001). An increasing percent reduction in LVESV was associated with progressively lower rates of HF or death, a finding consistent with a dose-response relation. In conclusion, approximately 90% of CRT-D-treated patients in MADIT-CRT had a significant and meaningful reduction in LVESV, and these LVESV responders had reduced rates of cardiac events during long-term follow-up.",

"Painful episodes of vaso-occlusion are the leading cause of hospitalizations and emergency department visits in sickle cell disease, and are associated with increased mortality. Low nitric oxide bioavailability contributes to vasculopathy in sickle cell disease. Since arginine is the obligate substrate for nitric oxide production, and an acute deficiency is associated with pain, we hypothesized that arginine may be a beneficial treatment for pain related to sickle cell disease. Thirty-eight children with sickle cell disease hospitalized for 56 episodes of pain were randomized into this double-blinded placebo-controlled trial. Patients received L-arginine (100 mg/kg tid) or placebo for 5 days or until discharge. A significant reduction in total parenteral opioid use by 54% (1.9 Â± 2.0 mg/kg versus 4.1 Â± 4.1 mg/kg, P=0.02) and lower pain scores at discharge (1.9 Â± 2.4 versus 3.9 Â± 2.9, P=0.01) were observed in the treatment arm compared to the placebo one. There was no significant difference in hospital length of stay (4.1 Â± 01.8 versus 4.8 Â± 2.5 days, P=0.34), although a trend favored the arginine arm, and total opioid use was strongly correlated with the duration of the admission (r=0.86, P<0.0001). No drug-related adverse events were observed. Arginine therapy represents a novel intervention for painful vaso-occlusive episodes. A reduction of narcotic use by >50% is remarkable. Arginine is a safe and inexpensive intervention with narcotic-sparing effects that may be a beneficial adjunct to standard therapy for sickle cell-related pain in children. A large multi-center trial is warranted in order to confirm these observations.",

"Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is being increasingly used as a first-line artemisinin combination treatment for malaria. The aim of this study was to describe the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of piperaquine in 236 children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Burkina Faso. They received a standard body weight-based oral 3-day fixed-dose dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine regimen. Capillary plasma concentration-time profiles were characterized using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. The population pharmacokinetics of piperaquine were described accurately by a two-transit-compartment absorption model and a three-compartment distribution model. Body weight was a significant covariate affecting clearance and volume parameters. The individually predicted day 7 capillary plasma concentration of piperaquine was an important predictor (P < 0.0001) of recurrent malaria infection after treatment. Young children (2-5 years of age) received a significantly higher body weight-normalized dose than older children (P = 0.025) but had significantly lower day 7 piperaquine concentrations (P = 0.024) and total piperaquine exposures (P = 0.021), suggesting that an increased dose regimen for young children should be evaluated.",

Among these patients, 4 relapsed, and 3 died within 3 months. Five patients had partial tumoral responses mainly located in soft tissues and for a duration ranging from 29-54 months. All patients with a hormonal response had objective improvement in clinical status and blood pressure. There was no clear-cut relationship between the cumulative dose and the responses. The main side-effect observed in 1 patient with widespread bone metastases after three doses (12.9 GBq) was a pancytopenia, which resolved after treatment was discontinued. This study suggests that repeated [131I]MIBG treatment could be effective in patients with advanced malignant pheochromocytoma.",

"Frequency and torment caused by migraines direct patients toward a variety of remedies. Few studies to date have proposed ginger derivates for migraine relief. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of ginger in the ablation of common migraine attack in comparison to sumatriptan therapy. In this double-blinded randomized clinical trial, 100 patients who had acute migraine without aura were randomly allocated to receive either ginger powder or sumatriptan. Time of headache onset, its severity, time interval from headache beginning to taking drug and patient self-estimation about response for five subsequent migraine attacks were recorded by patients. Patients(,) satisfaction from treatment efficacy and their willingness to continue it was also evaluated after 1âmonth following intervention. Two hours after using either drug, mean headaches severity decreased significantly. Efficacy of ginger powder and sumatriptan was similar. Clinical adverse effects of ginger powder were less than sumatriptan. Patients' satisfaction and willingness to continue did not differ. The effectiveness of ginger powder in the treatment of common migraine attacks is statistically comparable to sumatriptan. Ginger also poses a better side effect profile than sumatriptan.",

"The aim of this study was to asses the clinical features, pattern of healthcare and drug utilization of migraine patients attending 10 Italian headache centres (HC). Migraine is underdiagnosed and undertreated everywhere throughout the world, despite its considerable burden. Migraine sufferers often deal with their problem alone using self-prescribing drugs, whereas triptans are used by a small proportion of patients. All patients attending for the first time 10 Italian HCs over a 3-month period were screened for migraine. Migraine patients underwent a structured direct interview about previous migraine diagnosis, comorbidity, headache treatments and their side-effects and healthcare utilization for migraine. Patient satisfaction with their usual therapy for the migraine attack was evaluated with the Migraine-Assessment of Current Therapy (ACT) questionnaire. The quality of life of migraine patients was assessed by mean of Short Form (SF)-12 and Migraine-Specific Quality of life (MSQ) version 2.1 questionnaires. Of the 2675 patients who attended HCs for the first time during the study period, 71% received a diagnosis of migraine and the first 953 subjects completed the study out of 1025 patients enrolled. Only 26.8% of migraine patients had a previous diagnosis of migraine; 62.4% of them visited their general practitioner (GP) in the last year, 38.2% saw a specialist for headache, 23% attended an Emergency Department and 4.5% were admitted to hospital for migraine; 82.8% of patients used non-specific drugs for migraine attacks, whereas 17.2% used triptans and only 4.8% used a preventive migraine medication. Triptans were used by 46.4% of patients with a previous diagnosis of migraine. About 80% of migraine patients took over-the-counter medications. The Migraine-ACT revealed that 60% of patients needed a change in their treatment of migraine attacks, 85% of whom took non-specific drugs. Both the MSQ version 2.1 and the SF-12 questionnaires indicated a poor quality of life of most patients. Migraine represents the prevalent headache diagnosis in Italian HCs. Migraine is still underdiagnosed in Italy and migraine patients receive a suboptimal medical approach in our country, despite the healthcare utilization of migraine subjects being noteworthy. A cooperative network involving GPs, neurologists and headache specialists is strongly desirable in order to improve long-term migraine management in Italy.",
"Despite the important role of fluoroquinolones and the predominant use of ofloxacin for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa, there are limited data on ofloxacin pharmacokinetics in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, no ofloxacin pharmacokinetic data from South African patients, and no direct assessment of the relationship between ofloxacin pharmacokinetics and the MIC of ofloxacin of patient isolates. Our objectives are to describe ofloxacin pharmacokinetics in South African patients being treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and assess the adequacy of ofloxacin drug exposure with respect to the probability of pharmacodynamic target attainment (area under the time curve/MIC ratio of at least 100). Sixty-five patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were recruited from 2 hospitals in South Africa. We determined the ofloxacin MICs for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from baseline sputum specimens. Patients received daily doses of 800 mg ofloxacin, in addition to other antitubercular drugs. Patients underwent pharmacokinetic sampling at steady state. NONMEM was used for data analysis. The population pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin in this study has been adequately described. The probability of target attainment expectation in the study population was 0.45. Doubling the dose to 1,600 mg could increase this to only 0.77. The currently recommended ofloxacin dose appeared inadequate for the majority of this study population. Studies to assess the tolerability of higher doses are warranted. Alternatively, ofloxacin should be replaced with more potent fluoroquinolones.",

Corresponding TB services, if separate, were invited to complete a similar survey. Responses were received from 124 of 170 HIV services, and 18 corresponding TB services. Data were obtained for 236 coinfected patients. Despite some incomplete data, this audit yielded useful findings. Many positive smear results were unacceptably delayed. The TB therapy completion rate fell short of the chief medical officer's (CMO's) 85% target. Culture confirmation of pulmonary TB met the CMO's 65% target. A high number of patients were diagnosed with HIV during investigation of TB. Contrary to current guidelines, many services do not routinely test TB patients for HIV.",

"There is evidence that some antidepressant drugs are beneficial in the prophylaxis of migraine. Previous reports have shown that migraine patients may respond to various antidepressant agents used for prophylactic therapy. The main purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of antidepressants from 2 different groups (venlafaxine vs escitalopram) on people who had migraine headache without depression or anxiety. In this prospective study, we evaluated the headache diaries of 93 patients who were being treated with venlafaxine (n = 35) and escitalopram (n = 58). At the end of the 3-month period, patients were reassessed, and those with marked differences in attack frequency, duration, intensity (with visual analog scales), lost work-day equivalent index, and migraine disability assessment questionnaire were compared. There was a clear reduction in headache frequency (P < 0.0001), duration (P < 0.0001), and severity (P < 0.0001) in the venlafaxine group. In addition, there was a significant improvement in daily work performance during headaches (P < 0.0001). In the escitalopram group, monthly headache frequency (P < 0.026), duration (P < 0.002), and intensity (P < 0.027) all decreased significantly, although not to the same extent as with venlafaxine. After the third month of venlafaxine and escitalopram treatment, most of the patients (82.8% vs 96.5%) were seen to have moved to the minimal or infrequent migraine disability assessment group. According to our findings, venlafaxine and escitalopram are both effective in the prophylaxis of migraine headache without depression and anxiety. This effect was independent of mood disorder. Escitalopram should be the first choice because of its fewer side effects, but venlafaxine may be used if escitalopram is found to be insufficient.",

"We developed, implemented, and evaluated a myocardial infarction (MI) adjudication protocol for cohort research of human immunodeficiency virus. Potential events were identified through the centralized Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems data repository using MI diagnoses and/or cardiac enzyme laboratory results (1995-2012). Sites assembled de-identified packets, including physician notes and results from electrocardiograms, procedures, and laboratory tests. Information pertaining to the specific antiretroviral medications used was redacted for blinded review. Two experts reviewed each packet, and a third review was conducted if discrepancies occurred. Reviewers categorized probable/definite MIs as primary or secondary and identified secondary causes of MIs. The positive predictive value and sensitivity for each identification/ascertainment method were calculated. Of the 1,119 potential events that were adjudicated, 294 (26%) were definite/probable MIs. Almost as many secondary (48%) as primary (52%) MIs occurred, often as the result of sepsis or cocaine use. Of the patients with adjudicated definite/probable MIs, 78% had elevated troponin concentrations (positive predictive value = 57%, 95% confidence interval: 52, 62); however, only 44% had clinical diagnoses of MI (positive predictive value = 45%, 95% confidence interval: 39, 51). We found that central adjudication is crucial and that clinical diagnoses alone are insufficient for ascertainment of MI. Over half of the events ultimately determined to be MIs were not identified by clinical diagnoses. Adjudication protocols used in traditional cardiovascular disease cohorts facilitate cross-cohort comparisons but do not address issues such as identifying secondary MIs that may be common in persons with human immunodeficiency virus.",

"Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and hepatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have become reliable noninvasive tools to monitor iron excess in thalassemia major (TM) patients. However, long-term studies are lacking. We reviewed CMR and hepatic MRI T2* imaging on 54 TM patients who had three or more annual measurements. They were managed on various chelation regimens. Patients were grouped according to their degree of cardiac siderosis: severe (T2*, <10 msec), mild to moderate (T2* = 10-20 msec), and no cardiac siderosis (T2*, >20 msec). We looked at the change in cardiac T2*, liver iron concentration (LIC) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at years 3 and 5. In patients with severe cardiac siderosis, cardiac T2* (mean Â± SD) improved from 6.9 Â± 1.6 at baseline to 13.6 Â± 10.0 by year 5, mean ÎT2* = 6.7 (P = 0.04). Change in cardiac T2* at year 3 was not significant in the severe group. Patients with mild to moderate cardiac siderosis had mean cardiac T2* of 14.6 Â± 2.9 at baseline which improved to 26.3 Â± 9.5 by year 3, mean ÎT2* =â 1.7 (P = 0.01). At baseline, median LICs (mg/g dry weight) in patients with severe, mild-moderate, and no cardiac siderosis were 3.6, 2.8, and 3.3, whereas LVEFs (mean Â± SD) (%) were 56.3 Â± 10.1, 60 Â± 5, and 66 Â± 7.6, respectively. No significant correlation was noted between Î cardiac T2* and Î LIC, Î cardiac T2*, and Î LVEF at years 3 and 5. Throughout the observation period, patients with no cardiac siderosis maintained their cardiac T2* above 20 msec. The majority of patients with cardiac siderosis improve cardiac T2* over time with optimal chelation.",

"Several randomized controlled trials and observational studies have compared outcomes of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) with drug-eluting stents (DESs) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), but they have not thoroughly investigated the relative difference in outcomes for patients aged â¥75 years. In this study, a total of 3,864 patients receiving DES and CABG (1,932 CABG-DES pairs) with multivessel coronary disease were propensity matched using multiple patient risk factors and were compared with respect to 3 outcomes (mortality, stroke/myocardial infarction [MI]/mortality, and repeat revascularization) at 2.5 years with a mean follow-up of 18 months. The mortality rates (DES/CABG hazard ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.30) and the stroke/MI/mortality rates (DES/CABG hazard ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.38) for the 2 procedures were not significantly different.

"Soft-tissue sarcomas are rare tumours of mesenchymal origin. Patients with metastatic disease have a median survival of about 10 months. Doxorubicin, an anthracycline, is often used to reduce tumour volume, but it does not prolong overall survival. Pazopanib, a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor already marketed for kidney cancer, is now licensed for the treatment of certain metastatic soft-tissue sarcomas when chemotherapy fails or when the disease progresses despite adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical evaluation of pazopanib in this setting is based on a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 369 patients whose tumours had progressed despite at least one line of chemotherapy, based on an anthracycline. In this trial, pazopanib did not provide a statistically significant increase in overall survival. The median survival time was about 12 months. A statistically significant increase in median progression-free survival was observed (4.6 versus 1.6 months, an increase of 3 months), based mainly on radiological criteria. Pazopanib did not improve quality of life. The adverse effect profile includes cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and hepatic disorders, and palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia. Serious adverse effects are frequent. Other life-threatening adverse effects observed in patients with soft-tissue sarcoma include pneumothorax (especially in case of pulmonary metastasis), heart failure, venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and hypothyroidism. In practice, given its lack of any proven impact on overall survival and its excessive toxicity, the use of pazopanib is not justified. It is better to focus on appropriate symptomatic care in order to preserve these patients' quality of life.",
"Patients with SDHD-associated head-and-neck paragangliomas (HNP) are at risk for developing pheochromocytomas for which screening has been advised. To assess clinical, biochemical, and radiological outcomes of screening in a large single-center cohort of SDHD-positive patients with HNP and to address the necessity for repetitive follow-up, we evaluated 93 patients with SDHD-associated HNP (p.Asp92Tyr, p.Leu139Pro). Screening consisted of measurement of 24 h urinary excretion of catecholamines and/or their metabolites in duplicate, which was repeated with intervals of 2 years if initial biochemical screening was negative. In patients, in whom urinary excretion was above the reference limit, imaging studies with (123)I-MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) were performed. Pheochromocytomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas were treated surgically after appropriate blockade. Median follow-up was 4.5 years (range 0.5-19.5 years). Twenty-eight out of the 93 patients were included in our study and underwent additional imaging for pheochromocytomas/extra-adrenal paragangliomas. In 11 out of the 28 patients intra-adrenal pheochromocytomas were found. Extra-adrenal paragangliomas were discovered in eight patients. These tumors were detected during initial screening in 63% of cases, whereas 37% were detected after repeated biochemical screening. One patient was diagnosed with a biochemically silent pheochromocytoma. The high prevalence of pheochromocytomas/extra-adrenal paragangliomas in patients with SDHD-associated HNP warrants regular screening for tumors in these patients. Paragangliomas that do not secrete catecholamines might be more prevalent than previously reported. Future studies will have to establish whether routine imaging studies should be included in the screening of SDHD mutation carriers, irrespective of biochemical screening.",

"In an international multicenter trial infants with clinical and radiological signs of severe RDS (age 2-15 h, birthweight 700-2,000 g, mechanical ventilation, FiO2 greater than or equal to 0.6, no complicating disease) were randomized to receive either a single dose (n = 176) or up to three subsequent doses (n = 167) of a natural porcine surfactant (Curosurf). Using a logistic regression model, the effects of therapy, birthweight, sex, hospital and other clinical factors on survival and various outcome parameters were evaluated. Mortality (13 vs. 21%, p less than 0.05) and the incidence of pneumothorax (9 vs. 18%, p less than 0.01) were significantly lower in the multiple-dose group. Low birthweight, hospital allocation, low Apgar score and initial disease severity were associated with an increased mortality. Low birthweight, hypothermia (admission temperature less than 36 degrees C) and acidosis (pH less than 7.25) prior to surfactant treatment could be identified as risk factors for the development of intracranial hemorrhage.",

"Days to positivity in automated liquid mycobacterial culture have been shown to correlate with mycobacterial load and have been proposed as a useful biomarker for treatment responses in tuberculosis. However, there is currently no quantitative method or model to analyze the change in days to positivity with time on treatment. The objectives of this study were to describe the decline in numbers of mycobacteria in sputum collected once weekly for 8 weeks from patients on treatment for tuberculosis using days to positivity in liquid culture. One hundred forty-four patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were recruited from a tuberculosis clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. A nonlinear mixed-effects repeated-time-to-event modeling approach was used to analyze the time-to-positivity data. A biexponential model described the decline in the estimated number of bacteria in patients' sputum samples, while a logistic model with a lag time described the growth of the bacteria in liquid culture. At baseline, the estimated number of rapidly killed bacteria is typically 41 times higher than that of those that are killed slowly. The time to kill half of the rapidly killed bacteria was about 1.8 days, while it was 39 days for slowly killed bacteria. Patients with lung cavitation had higher bacterial loads than patients without lung cavitation. The model successfully described the increase in days to positivity as treatment progressed, differentiating between bacteria that are killed rapidly and those that are killed slowly. Our model can be used to analyze similar data from studies testing new drug regimens.",
"Although it has been shown that elevated white blood cell count (WBCc) on presentation is associated with an increased risk of cardiac mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the responsible mechanisms are unknown. We therefore sought to investigate whether elevated WBCc is associated with increased infarct size measured with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 30Â days after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in the Intracoronary Abciximab and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients With Large Anterior Myocardial Infarction trial. INFUSE AMI randomized patients with STEMI and proximal or mid-left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion to bolus intracoronary abciximab versus no abciximab and to manual aspiration versus no aspiration. WBCc at hospital admission was available in 407 of 452 randomized patients. Patients were stratified according to tertiles of WBCc. At 30Â days, a significant stepwise increase in infarct size (percentage of total left ventricular mass) was apparent across tertiles of increasing WBCc (median [interquartile range] for tertiles I vs II vs IIIÂ = 11.2% [3.8% to 19.6%] vs 17.5% [0.5% to 22.9%] vs 19.1% [13.7 to 26.0], respectively, p <0.0001). Absolute infarct mass in grams and abnormal wall motion score were also significantly increased across tertiles of WBC. By multivariate linear regression analysis, WBCc was an independent predictor of infarct size along with intracoronary abciximab randomization, age, time from symptom onset to first device, proximal left anterior descending location, and baseline TIMI flow of 0/1. In conclusion, in patients with anterior wall STEMI, an elevated admission WBCc is a powerful independent predictor of infarct size measured with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 30Â days after primary percutaneous coronary intervention.",

"The correlation between plasma D-dimer level and reperfusion has not been clarified yet in thrombolytic therapy applied for acute myocardial infarction patients. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a relationship between reperfusion and fibrinolytic activity in acute myocardial infarction patients treated with thrombolytic therapy. Fibrinolytic activity was reflected by plasma D-dimer levels. During the study period, 186 patients were initially analyzed. But 18 of these patients were excluded from the study because they were not suitable for study criteria. Blood was collected from 168 acute myocardial infarction patients within first 6 h. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (100 mg) or streptokinase (1,500,000 U) was applied to patients. Mean age of the patients was 58 (28-86) years and majority was men (86%). The number of anterior, inferior, and lateral myocardial infarction patients were 76 (45.2%), 85 (50.6%), and seven (4.2%), respectively. The mean time from symptom onset to thrombolytic application was 134 (95-212) min. Reperfusion occurred in 115 (68.5%) patients. D-dimer levels were markedly high after thrombolytic therapy versus before (155 mg/dl, 362 mg/dl, P<0.005). We compared the D-dimer values before and after thrombolytic therapy between reperfused group and the nonreperfused group (189-409 mg/l in reperfused group, P=0.086; 82-258 mg/l in the nonreperfused group, P=0.173). In conclusion, in this study, D-dimer levels were elevated markedly in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction after thrombolytic therapy, but no significant difference was seen in D-dimer levels between the reperfused and nonreperfused groups.",

"Pediatric drug formulations of artemisinin combination therapies are urgently needed for improving the treatment of children suffering from uncomplicated malaria. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a novel pediatric fixed-dose granule formulation of artesunate-mefloquine and a new co-blister tablet formulation. A total of 71 children aged 1-13 years suffering from uncomplicated falciparum malaria were stratified into two groups according to weight: 10-20 kg, pediatric group (n = 41); 20-40 kg, tablet group (n = 30). All the children were treated once daily for three days: the pediatric group received the novel granule formulation, the tablet group received the co-blister tablets. The PCR-corrected cure rate on day 28 was evaluated. There was no reappearance of parasitemia during the follow-up period and the day-28 cure rate was therefore 100% in per-protocol analysis. In intention-to-treat analysis the cure rates were 95% in the pediatric group and 97% in the tablet group. The most frequent adverse events were vomiting (17%), abdominal pain (11%) and headache (17%). This study confirms the excellent efficacy and favorable safety and tolerability profile of a novel pediatric artesunate-mefloquine formulation for treatment in African children.",

"Previously, we have documented primary testicular failure in adult male subjects with sickle cell anemia. We have also reported the occurrence of zinc deficiency and suggested that androgen deficiency may be related to zinc deficiency in such patients. In this study, we present data with respect to the efferent of oral zinc supplementation on serum testosterone levels in adult male patients with sickle cell anemia. An increase in serum testosterone, neutrophil zinc, and neutrophil alkaline phosphatase activity ws observed in the zinc-supplemented group in comparison with the group on placebo. Additionally, body weight increased and serum lactic dehydrogenase activity decrease in response to zinc supplementation. We conclude that androgen deficiency in adult male subjects with sickle cell anemia is correctable with zinc supplementation and that the determination of neutrophil zinc and alkaline phosphatase activity in the neutrophils may be utilized as good indicators of body zinc status in such subjects.",

We carried out qualitative research interviews with 21 TB patients in four selected TB and HIV/AIDS treatment centres in the Northwest Region of Cameroon to explore the facilitators and barriers to HIV testing. The desire to be healthy and live longer from knowing one's status inspired by the anticipated support from loved ones, faith in a supreme being, influence and trust in the medical authority, encouraged HIV testing. Men also demonstrated their masculinity by testing, thus portraying themselves as positive role models for other men. Meanwhile, the overwhelming burden of facing both TB and HIV simultaneously, influenced by the fear of disclosure of results, harmful gender norms and practices, fear of stigma and discrimination, and misconceptions surrounding HIV/AIDS deterred HIV testing. However, as a result of conflicting emotional experiences regarding to test or not to test, the decision-making process was not straightforward and this complex process needs to be acknowledged by health care providers when advocating for routine HIV testing among TB patients.",

"Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent neuropeptide whose agonist interaction with the CGRP receptor (CGRP-R) in the periphery promotes vasodilation, neurogenic inflammation and trigeminovascular sensory activation. This process is implicated in the cause of migraine headaches, and CGRP-R antagonists in clinical development have proven effective in treating migraine-related pain in humans. CGRP-R is expressed on blood vessel smooth muscle and sensory trigeminal neurons and fibers in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system. However, it is not clear what role the inhibition of central CGRP-R plays in migraine pain relief. To this end, the CGRP-R positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [(11)C]MK-4232 (2-[(8R)-8-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-6,8-[6-(11)C]dimethyl-10-oxo-6,9-diazaspiro[4.5]decan-9-yl]-N-[(2R)-2'-oxospiro[1,3-dihydroindene-2,3'-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine]-5-yl]acetamide) was discovered and developed for use in clinical PET studies. In rhesus monkeys and humans, [(11)C]MK-4232 displayed rapid brain uptake and a regional brain distribution consistent with the known distribution of CGRP-R. Monkey PET studies with [(11)C]MK-4232 after intravenous dosing with CGRP-R antagonists validated the ability of [(11)C]MK-4232 to detect changes in CGRP-R occupancy in proportion to drug plasma concentration. Application of [(11)C]MK-4232 in human PET studies revealed that telcagepant achieved only low receptor occupancy at an efficacious dose (140 mg PO). Therefore, it is unlikely that antagonism of central CGRP-R is required for migraine efficacy. However, it is not known whether high central CGRP-R antagonism may provide additional therapeutic benefit.",

"Controlling malaria in pregnancy has been an important component of the millennium development goal and intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) is considered an important tool in controlling malaria among pregnant women. In this study, we evaluated the level of compliance to IPT use as well as its effect on malaria infection among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic in south eastern Nigeria. Peripheral blood smears and placental histology were used as diagnostic tools to determine infection rate. Our data show that compliance to IPT use was poor (33%) when compared with non-compliance (67%). Infection rate was significantly lower among IPT users (39%) than in non-users (71%) (X(2) = 39Â·95; P<0Â·05). Maternal anaemia was also lower in IPT users (4%) than in non-users (18%). Taken together, IPT use appears to be important in reducing infection rate and maternal anaemia.

"A post hoc analysis of the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT) II showed that patients with high mortality risk score did not benefit from implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy. We sought to determine whether MADIT II risk score can identify patients with greater mortality in a nontrial "real-world" setting. We included 382 consecutive patients who received ICD for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center from 2006 to 2010. MADIT II score was calculated by assigning 1 point each for age >70 years, New York Heart Association class >II, atrial fibrillation, QRS >0.12 seconds, and blood urea nitrogen level >26 mg/dl. Scores 0, 1 to 2, and â¥3 were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively. Of the 382 patients, 14% were low risk, 54% intermediate risk, and 32% high risk. After 3.0 Â± 1.6 years of follow-up, incidence of appropriate ICD shocks was similar (p = 0.21) across MADIT II risk score categories. However, mortality rate was 21, 54, and 134 per 1,000 patient-year follow-up in low, intermediate, and high-risk patients, respectively, p <0.0001. Compared with low-risk patients, mortality was 6.4Ã greater in high-risk patients (hazard ratio 6.36, 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 20.5; p = 0.002). The c-index for the MADIT II score for predicting death was 0.69 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.75). In conclusion, MADIT II risk score successfully identified patients with greater mortality in a nontrial-based, primary-prevention ICD cohort.",

"Spontaneous pneumothorax has been managed on an outpatient basis by intercostal tube drainage and a portable flutter valve device (pneumothorax set). In a series of 111 selected patients, from 14 to 75 years of age, who had no complaints such as dyspnea, had neither tension-nor hemo-pneumothorax, and could promptly return to hospital in an emergency, intercostal tube insertion and continuous negative pressure drainage were instituted at the outpatient department. After approximately one hour of suction, if an air leak ceased and the lung was re-expanded, the patient was allowed to return home with a pneumothorax set connected to the chest tube. But, if an air leak persisted, they were admitted to hospital. The outpatients were followed every 2 or 3 days thereafter, and if their course was uneventful, the chest tube was removed a week later. If the onset of lung recollapse was seen at outpatient check up, hospitalization was required. Outpatient treatment was successful in 81 cases (72.9%) of the series. However, 14 patients were hospitalized because of persistent air leak at the outpatient room, and 5 were admitted because of wound pain, re-expansion edema or other reasons. During the ambulatory course, 11 were admitted to hospital with recollapse of the lung. Bacterial cultures of drain tips were positive in 22.6% of 75 examined cases, which was a higher percentage than that associated with inpatient drainage. Wound infection with St. aureus occurred in one case after removal of the drain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

"This study highlights the advantages of sutureless valves for geriatric patients with small aortic roots reflected by shorter cross-clamp and CPB times, even though most of these patients were operated on via a minimally invasive access. Moreover, due to the absence of a sewing ring, these valves are also almost stentless, with greater effective orifice area (EOA) for any given size.

This is of advantage, as several studies have shown that aortic root enlargement can significantly increase the risks of AVR. Moreover, as seen in this series, these valves may also enable a broader application of minimally invasive AVR.",

"Iron overload is not uncommon in sickle cell disease (SCD) and requires regular chelation therapy in several instances. The present study evaluates the effect of deferiprone in 15 adult patients with SCD (ten beta(s)/beta(0)thalassemia and five beta(s)/beta(s)) and iron overload. Deferiprone was given at a dose of 75 mg/kg daily for 12 months. The evaluation considered pre- and post-treatment values of serum ferritin, urinary iron excretion, and T2 values of liver and heart obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Eleven patients had a liver biopsy prior to starting therapy to evaluate iron concentration (LIC). Twelve patients completed the study with satisfactory compliance. In ten of them (83.3%) the serum ferritin levels decreased significantly at the end of the trial; in eight patients (66.6%) the reduction of serum ferritin was accompanied by a significant increase of their liver T2 values. All patients had a significant increase of urinary iron excretion in response to the drug. Ferritin levels and liver T2 values correlated with liver iron concentration; on the contrary, ferritin levels and liver T2 values failed to show any correlation with heart T2 values. Heart T2 values did not also show any correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction. Deferiprone was well tolerated and did not cause any significant adverse effects. These results suggest that deferiprone may effectively decrease the iron deposition in patients with SCD; moreover, T2 MRI proves to be a reliable and rapid, noninvasive method for assessing the liver iron load in patients with SCD.",

"The authors evaluated the incidence and type of technical problems associated with blind insertion of intrapleural catheters placed in 21 anesthetized patients and then injected in a double-blind fashion with 0.5% bupivacaine (1.5 mg/kg) or isotonic saline. The patients' chests were then opened, catheter positions located, and the lungs inspected. Eleven of the catheters were located with the tips intrapleurally, three extrapleurally, and seven actually in lung tissue. Eight patients had holes in the lung surface. Three patients had a pneumothorax, two of which were under tension. Plasma bupivacaine levels reached maximal concentrations at about 20 minutes in those with intrapleurally placed catheters, but not until 60 minutes when the catheter had actually penetrated the lung. Significant variations in plasma bupivacaine levels were achieved when the catheter entered lung tissue, with potentially toxic levels in one patient. To evaluate intraoperative analgesic effects, all patients were given a standard anesthetic with isoflurane, oxygen, and a muscle relaxant. There was no significant difference in isoflurane requirement between the groups who had bupivacaine v saline injected into their intrapleural catheters before surgery. It is concluded that blind insertion of intrapleural catheters can be hazardous, especially if followed by positive-pressure ventilation. In addition, catheter placement in lung tissue, which was not uncommon, delays the time for peak plasma concentrations and may increase risk of toxicity. Intrapleural bupivacaine was not found to be a useful adjunct to general anesthesia during thoracotomies.",

"To estimate medication costs in individuals with diagnosed diabetes, undetected diabetes, impaired glucose regulation and normal blood glucose values in a population-based sample by age and sex.Using the KORA F4 follow-up survey, conducted in 2006-2008 (n=2611, age 40-82 years), we identified individuals' glucose tolerance status by means of an oral glucose tolerance test. We assessed all medications taken regularly, calculated age-sex specific medication costs and estimated cost ratios for total, total without antihyperglycemic drugs, and cardiovascular medication, using multiple 2-part regression models.Compared to individuals with normal glucose values, costs were increased in known diabetes, undetected diabetes and impaired glucose regulation, which was more pronounced in participants aged 40-59 years than in those aged 60-82 years (cost ratios for all medications: 40-59 years: 2.85; 95%-confidence interval: 1.78-4.54, 2.00; 1.22-3.29 and 1.53; 1.12-2.09; 60-82 years: 2.04; 1.71-2.43, 1.17; 0.90-1.51 and 1.09; 0.94-1.28).

"Pregnant women are susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum parasites that sequester in the placenta. The massive accumulation of infected erythrocytes in the placenta has been suggested to trigger the deleterious effects of malaria in pregnant women and their offspring. The risk of malaria is also high during the postpartum period, although mechanisms underlying this susceptibility are not known. Here, we aimed to identify host factors contributing to the risk of postpartum infections and to determine the origin of postpartum parasites by comparing their genotypes with those present at the time of delivery. To address this, blood samples were collected at delivery (n = 402) and postpartum (n = 354) from Mozambican women enrolled in a trial of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp). P. falciparum was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the parasite merozoite surface protein 1 (msp-1) and msp-2 genes were genotyped. Fifty-seven out of 354 (16%) women were infected postpartum as assessed by qPCR, whereas prevalence by optical microscopy was only 4%. Risk of postpartum infection was lower in older women (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.15 to 0.81) and higher in women with a placental infection at delivery (OR = 4.20, 95% CI = 2.19 to 8.08). Among 24 women with matched infections, 12 (50%) were infected postpartum with at least one parasite strain that was also present in their placentas. These results suggest that parasites infecting pregnant women persist after delivery and increase the risk of malaria during the postpartum period. Interventions that reduce malaria during pregnancy may translate into a lower risk of postpartum infection.",
"Vasoocclusion is a continuous process in sickle cell disease (SCD) and accumulates to significant end organ damage, mostly irrespective of the occurrence of manifest acute vasoocclusive events. As there are indications that reversing the hypercoagulable state may be of clinical benefit in sickle cell patients, we performed a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over pilot study to assess the efficacy and safety of low-adjusted dose acenocoumarol therapy (International Normalized Ratio: 1.6-2.0) in SCD. Treatment consisted of either acenocoumarol or placebo for 14 weeks, after which treatment was discontinued for a period of five weeks. Then, patients initially on acenocoumarol received placebo (and vice versa) for 14 weeks. Therapy efficacy was assessed by comparing the frequency of vasoocclusive complications, the occurrence of bleeding, and clotting activation between acenocoumarol and placebo treatment of each individual patient. Twenty-two patients (14 homozygous [HbSS] and 8 double heterozygous sickle-C [HbSC]; aged 20-59 years) completed the entire study. Acenocoumarol treatment did not result in a significant reduction of acute vasoocclusive events (three painful crises during acenocoumarol, five painful crises during placebo). There was a marked reduction of the hypercoagulable state (depicted by a decrease in plasma levels of prothrombin F1.2 fragments [P = 0.002], thrombin-antithrombin complexes [P = 0.003], and D-dimer fragments [P = 0.001]) without the occurrence of major bleeding. Even though no clinical benefit (pertaining to the frequency of painful crises) was detected in this pilot study, the value of low adjusted-dose acenocoumarol for preventing specific events (such as strokes) and as a long-term treatment of sickle cell patients should be subject of further study.",

"A previous pilot study suggested that rizatriptan reduces motion sickness induced by complex vestibular stimulation. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study we measured motion sickness in response to a complex vestibular stimulus following pretreatment with either rizatriptan or a placebo. Subjects included 25 migraineurs with or without migraine-related dizziness (23 females) aged 21-45 years (31.0 Â± 7.8 years). Motion sickness was induced by off-vertical axis rotation in darkness, which stimulates both the semicircular canals and otolith organs of the vestibular apparatus. Results indicated that of the 15 subjects who experienced vestibular-induced motion sickness when pretreated with placebo, 13 showed a decrease in motion sickness following pretreatment with rizatriptan as compared to pretreatment with placebo (P < 0.02). This significant effect was not seen when subjects were exposed to more provocative vestibular stimulation. We conclude that the serotonin agonist, rizatriptan, reduces vestibular-induced motion sickness by influencing serotonergic vestibular-autonomic projections.",

"IP-10 has potential as a diagnostic marker for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with comparable accuracy to QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-IT). The aims were to assess the sensitivity and specificity of IP-10, and to evaluate the impact of co-morbidity on IP-10 and QFT-IT. 168 cases with active TB, 101 healthy controls and 175 non-TB patients were included. IP-10 and IFN-Î³ were measured in plasma of QFT-IT stimulated whole blood and analyzed using previously determined algorithms. A subgroup of 48 patients and 70 healthy controls was tested in parallel with T-SPOT.TB IP-10 and QFT-IT had comparable accuracy. Sensitivity was 81% and 84% with a specificity of 97% and 100%, respectively. Combining IP-10 and QFT-IT improved sensitivity to 87% (p < 0.0005), with a specificity of 97%. T-SPOT.TB was more sensitive than QFT-IT, but not IP-10. Among non-TB patients IP-10 had a higher rate of positive responders (35% vs 27%, p < 0.02) and for both tests a positive response was associated with relevant risk factors. IFN-Î³ but not IP-10 responses to mitogen stimulation were reduced in patients with TB and non-TB infection. This study confirms and validates previous findings and adds substance to IP-10 as a novel diagnostic marker for infection with M. tuberculosis. IP-10 appeared less influenced by infections other than TB; further studies are needed to test the clinical impact of these findings.",

"The objective of this study was to assess patient satisfaction with acute treatment of migraine with frovatriptan or rizatriptan by preference questionnaire. 148 subjects with a history of migraine with or without aura (IHS 2004 criteria), with at least one migraine attack per month in the preceding 6 months, were enrolled and randomized to frovatriptan 2.5 mg or rizatriptan 10 mg treating 1-3 attacks. The study had a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, with treatment periods lasting <3 months. At the end of the study, patients assigned preference to one of the treatments using a questionnaire with a score from 0 to 5 (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints were pain-free and pain relief episodes at 2 h, and recurrent and sustained pain-free episodes within 48 h. 104 of the 125 patients (83%, intention-to-treat population) expressed a preference for a triptan. The average preference score was not significantly different between frovatriptan (2.9Â±1.3) and rizatriptan (3.2Â±1.1). The rates of pain-free (33% frovatriptan vs. 39% rizatriptan) and pain relief (55 vs. 62%) episodes at 2 h were not significantly different between the two treatments. The rate of recurrent episodes was significantly (p<0.001) lower under frovatriptan (21 vs. 43% rizatriptan). No significant differences were observed in sustained pain-free episodes (26% frovatriptan vs. 22% rizatriptan). The number of patients with adverse events was not significantly different between rizatriptan (34) and frovatriptan (25, p=NS). The results suggest that frovatriptan has a similar efficacy to rizatriptan, but a more prolonged duration of action.",

"The motility and invasion of Plasmodium parasites is believed to require a cytoplasmic actin-myosin motor associated with a cell surface ligand belonging to the TRAP (thrombospondin-related anonymous protein) family. Current models of invasion usually invoke the existence of specific receptors for the TRAP-family ligands on the surface of the host cell; however, the identities of these receptors remain largely unknown. Here, we identify the GPI-linked protein Semaphorin-7A (CD108) as an erythrocyte receptor for the P. falciparum merozoite-specific TRAP homolog (MTRAP) by using a systematic screening approach designed to detect extracellular protein interactions. The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by showing that binding was saturable and by quantifying the equilibrium and kinetic biophysical binding parameters using surface plasmon resonance. We found that two MTRAP monomers interact via their tandem TSR domains with the Sema domains of a Semaphorin-7A homodimer. Known naturally-occurring polymorphisms in Semaphorin-7A did not quantitatively affect MTRAP binding nor did the presence of glycans on the receptor. Attempts to block the interaction during in vitro erythrocyte invasion assays using recombinant proteins and antibodies showed no significant inhibitory effect, suggesting the inaccessibility of the complex to proteinaceous blocking agents. These findings now provide important experimental evidence to support the model that parasite TRAP-family ligands interact with specific host receptors during cellular invasion.",

"It is unknown whether left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) diagnosis by electrocardiography improves risk stratification in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated the prognostic impact of LVH diagnosis by electrocardiography in a large sample of anticoagulated patients with AF included in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy (RE-LY) Study. We defined electrographic LVH (ECG-LVH) by strain pattern or Cornell voltage (R wave in aVL plus S wave in V3) >2.0 mV (women) or >2.4 mV (men). LVH prevalence was 22.7%. During a median follow-up of 2.0 years, 303 patients developed a stroke, 778 died (497 from cardiovascular causes), and 140 developed a myocardial infarction. LVH was associated with a greater risk of stroke (1.99% vs 1.32% per year, hazard ratio [HR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.93, p <0.001), cardiovascular death (4.52% vs 1.80% per year, HR 2.56, 95% CI 2.14 to 3.06, p <0.0001), all-cause death (6.03% vs 3.11% per year, HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.26, p <0.0001), and myocardial infarction (1.11% vs 0.55% per year, HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.92, p <0.0001). In multivariate analysis, the prognostic value of LVH was additive to CHA2DS2-VASc score and other covariates.

"A questionnaire (Migraine Questionnaire; MQ) was developed to help pharmacists identify consumers with migraine suitable for non-prescription treatment with a triptan. Adults, who knew or thought that they had migraine, participated in three, sequential, community-based studies to validate the MQ. Overall, 1,353 subjects completed independent assessments with a pharmacist and a clinician (reference standard). The accuracy of the pharmacist assessment of suitability for a triptan was compared with the clinician assessment. Clinicians using their standard practice determined that triptan therapy was suitable in 76.8% of cases compared with 48.8% for pharmacists using the MQ. The lack of concordance between pharmacists and clinicians in the false-positive cases (n = 113 of 660 subjects considered suitable for triptan by the pharmacists) usually related to headache diagnosis (57.5%), not safety aspects. The MQ is an effective tool for pharmacists to guide appropriate recommendation of a non-prescription triptan for migraine.",

"Several sports have been associated with a postexercise increase of cardiac, liver, and skeletal muscle biomarkers of injury. Exhaustive or acute physical exercise causes an increased generation of reactive oxygen species, resulting in cellular injury. Thus, exercise and training may trigger pathophysiological changes in serum concentrations of a variety of biomarkers. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the variation of novel biomarkers of stress and cardiovascular disease such as copeptin, midregional part of proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM), growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, and placental growth factor along with uric acid before and after acute high-intensity exercise and allopurinol administration. We also assessed whether allopurinol administration may affect the circulating levels of these biomarkers by inhibition of XO activity. This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which 12 professional football players were divided into 2 experimental groups. An oral dose of 300 mg of allopurinol was administered to one group of six participants 4 hours before a match of the Spanish Football League, whereas the other 6 participants received placebo (cellulose). Venous blood samples were obtained before the match (baseline) and twelve hours afterwards (post-match). Serum MR-proADM levels increased significantly in the placebo group, whereas serum GDF15 levels increased significantly in both the placebo and allopurinol group after the match. No differences in the other parameters tested were found after the match in any experimental group.

"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors prevent degradation of incretin hormones (glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1] and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP]), whereas metformin may increase GLP-1 levels. We examined, in a four-period crossover trial, the influence of metformin (2,000 mg/day), sitagliptin (100 mg/day), or their combination, on GLP-1 responses and on the incretin effect in 20 patients with type 2 diabetes, comparing an oral glucose challenge (75 g, day 5) and an "isoglycemic" intravenous glucose infusion (day 6). Fasting total GLP-1 was significantly increased by metformin and not changed by sitagliptin. After oral glucose, metformin increased and sitagliptin significantly decreased (by 53%) total GLP-1. Fasting and postload intact GLP-1 increased with sitagliptin but not with metformin. After oral glucose, only sitagliptin, but not metformin, significantly augmented insulin secretion, in monotherapy and as an add-on to metformin. The incretin effect was not changed numerically with any of the treatments. In conclusion, sitagliptin increased intact GLP-1 and GIP through DPP-4 inhibition but reduced total GLP-1 and GIP (feedback inhibition) without affecting the numerical contribution of the incretin effect. Insulin secretion with sitagliptin treatment was similarly stimulated with oral and "isoglycemic" intravenous glucose. This points to an important contribution of small changes in incretin concentrations within the basal range or to additional insulinotropic agents besides GLP mediating the antidiabetic effects of DPP-4 inhibition.",

"Decreased arterial compliance is an early manifestation of adverse structural and functional changes within the vessel wall. Its correlation with left ventricular (LV) area on computed tomography, a marker of LV remodeling, has not been well demonstrated. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that decreasing aortic compliance and increasing arterial stiffness are independently associated with increased LV area. The study population consisted of 3,540 patients (mean age 61 Â± 10 years, 46% men) from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who underwent aortic distensibility (AD) assessment on magnetic resonance imaging and LV area measurement on computed tomography (adjusted to body surface area). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the association between body surface area-normalized LV area >75th percentile and AD after adjusting for baseline clinical, historical, and imaging covariates. Mean LV area index was 2,153 cm(2), and mean AD was 1.84 Ã 10(3) mm Hg(-1). Subjects in the lowest AD quartile were older, with higher prevalence rates of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia (p <0.05 for all comparisons). Using multivariate linear regression adjusting for demographics, traditional risk factors, coronary artery calcium, and C-reactive protein, each SD decrease was associated with an 18-cm(2) increase in LV area. In addition, decreasing AD quartiles were independently associated with increasing LV area index, defined as >75th percentile. In conclusion, in this multiethnic cohort, reduced AD was associated with increased LV area. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine if decreased distensibility precedes and directly influences increased LV area.",

"The multicenter study of hydroxyurea (MSH) in sickle-cell anemia (SCA) demonstrated that patients treated with hydroxyurea (HU) had a 44% decrease in hospitalizations when compared with those taking placebo. A subsequent study looking at the cost-effectiveness of HU showed that decreased hospitalizations for painful crisis accounted for the majority of cost savings in those taking HU. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the expected decrease in hospital utilization occurred after the approval of HU in Maryland. We used data collected by the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission to obtain SCA discharge data for Maryland from FY1995 through FY2003. We also reviewed the inpatient and outpatient charts of all adults with SCA admitted to a large university hospital during 2003. Hospitalization rates for adults with SCA in Maryland have increased significantly since approval of HU. While the total costs of inpatient care in Maryland are estimated to have increased by 31% above inflation from 1995 to 2003, the costs of inpatient care for adult SCA patients has increased by almost 60% above inflation. By comparison, there has been no significant increase in the pediatric hospitalization rate. We found that 70% of patients in one hospital who were appropriate candidates for HU were not taking the medication. Hospital utilization among adults with SCA has increased significantly. There are likely many factors that have played a role in this increase. One factor that appears to be involved is the underutilization of HU.",

"The Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH), a double-blind randomized clinical trial, compared the frequency of acute vaso-occlusive (painful) crises during 2 yr of follow-up in 299 patients randomly assigned to hydroxyurea or placebo. Most patients had more than one crisis; all crises reported were included in the primary outcome analysis. A total of 7,229 follow-up medical contact reports were classified as crises/not crises by a Crisis Review Committee. Because of the time required to report, document, and classify contacts, interim analyses were prepared with incomplete data. If a stopping boundary were crossed, early termination could be advised only after assessing the potential impact of the incomplete data. In an extension of stochastic curtailment methods, simulation procedures were used to estimate the probability of detecting differences when group crisis rates projected to the end of the study were compared using a rank test. To account for medical contacts not yet reported and the future occurrence of crises, Poisson process models assuming no treatment effect on crisis rates were used for these simulations. The number of unclassified contacts that would be classified as crises was simulated as a binomial random variable.

"In this open trial we evaluated the possible efficacy of Ginkgolide B in the treatment of acute aura in a group of patients suffering from migraine with aura, considering in particular the effect of the treatment on aura duration. Twenty-five patients (16 females, 9 males, mean age 39.7 Â± 13.5 years, range 18-65) suffering from migraine with aura were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis was made according to the diagnostic criteria of the international classification of headache disorders, second edition (ICHD-II), for typical aura with migraine headache (n = 19) or typical aura without headache (n = 6). Patients were asked to use a diary card to register the exact duration of the aura symptoms in two consecutive attacks of aura. In the first one, they only took note of the duration of neurological symptoms in minutes. In the following attack, they were instructed to take orally, immediately at the onset of the first symptoms of aura, two capsules of a combination of 60 mg Ginkgo biloba terpenes phytosome, 11 mg coenzyme Q 10 and 8.7 mg vitamin B2 (Migrasoll). Aura duration (expressed in minutes) was significantly (p < 0.001) reduced by Migrasoll intake, being 33.6 Â± 11.5 in the first untreated attack and 21.9 Â± 11.8 during the second attack. In general, there was a marked amelioration of the features of the neurological symptoms of aura in the treated attack. In four patients (18.1 %) suffering from typical aura with migraine, the pain phase disappeared. Among the patients who completed the study no serious adverse events were reported.",
"Efficacy and safety of sumatriptan in rectal suppository (50 mg) and tablet forms (50 mg) in stopping migraine attacks has been studied in 80 patients with migraine with or without aura. Dynamics of migraine pain intensity measured with the VAS 30 min, 1, 2, 6 and 24 h after the first dose of drug was a primary index of efficacy. Secondary indices were the VAS intensity of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, duration of each migraine attack, quality of life parameters of a patient during the migraine attack assessed with the 24-hour questionnaire, severity of migraine course on the MIDAS, percentage of patients with complete regression of migraine pain, at least in 2 out of 3 attacks. To assess drug safety, any adverse effects, data of instrumental methods (clinical and biochemical blood tests, clinical urine test), EKG were taken into account. Rectal suppository had the more rapid effect on headache reduction compared to tablets. Changes of intensity of concomitant symptoms (nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia) as well as other secondary indices of drug efficacy were similar in both groups. In the group treated with rectal suppository, 9 (22.5%) patients had 12 adverse effects. In the group treated with tablets, 22 adverse effects were noted in 15 (37.5%) patients. Adverse effects related to the cardio-vascular system were observed less often in the group treated with rectal suppository (6.6 and 32%, respectively, p=0,004).",
"Although electrocardiography is frequently used as an initial test to detect or rule out previous myocardial infarction (MI), the diagnostic performance of commonly used electrocardiographic scoring systems is not well described. We aimed to determine the diagnostic accuracy of (1) the Universal Definition, (2) Minnesota ECG Code (MC), (3) Selvester QRS Score, and (4) assessment by cardiologists using late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging as the reference standard. Additionally, the effect of electrocardiographic patterns and infarct characteristics on detecting previous MI was evaluated. The 3-month follow-up electrocardiograms of 78 patients with first-time reperfused ST elevation MI were pooled with electrocardiograms of 36 healthy controls. All 114 electrocardiograms were randomly analyzed, blinded to clinical and LGE-CMR data. The sensitivity of the Universal Definition, MC, Selvester QRS Score, and cardiologists toÂ detect previous MI was 33%, 79%, 90%, and 67%, respectively; specificity 97%, 72%, 31%, and 89%, respectively; diagnostic accuracy 54%, 77%, 71%, and 74%, respectively. Probability of detecting MI by cardiologists increased with an increasing number (odds ratio [OR] 2.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30 to 3.09), width (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.03), and depth (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.27) of Q waves as well as increasing infarct size (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.25) and transmurality (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08; p <0.05 for all). The time-consuming MC and rapid visual assessment by cardiologists achieved the best and similar diagnostic accuracies to detect previous MI. The diagnostic performance of all 4 electrocardiographic scoring systems was modest and related to the number, depth, and width of Q waves as well as increasing infarct size and transmurality. In conclusion, the exclusion of a previous MI based solely on electrocardiographic findings should be done with caution. Future studies are needed to define which patients should be referred to additional diagnostic testing.",

"Human models of headache may contribute to understanding of prostaglandins' role in migraine pathogenesis. The current thesis investigated the migraine triggering effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in migraine patients without aura, the efficacy of a novel EP4 receptor antagonist, BGC20-1531, in prevention of PGE2-induced headache and the ability of prostaglandin F2Î± (PGF2Î±) to trigger headache without any vasodilatation in healthy volunteers. All studies were designed as double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over experiments, where PGE2/PGF2Î± or saline were infused over 20-25 min. In the study with EP4 receptor antagonist healthy volunteers were pre-treated with two different doses of BGC20-1531 or placebo followed by PGE2 infusion over 25 min. The headache data were collected during the whole study day, whereas the possible vascular changes were measured during the in-hospital phase of 1.5 h. The infusion of PGE2 caused the immediate migraine-like attacks and vasodilatation of the middle cerebral artery in migraine patients without aura. The highly specific and potent EP4 receptor antagonist, BGC20-1531, was not able to attenuate PGE2-induced headache and vasodilatation of both intra- and extra-cerebral arteries. The intravenous infusion of PGF2Î± did not induce headache or statistically significant vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries in healthy volunteers. Novel data on PGE2-provoked immediate migraine-like attacks suggest that PGE2 may be one of the important final products in the pathogenesis of migraine. The lack of efficacy of EP4 receptor antagonist suggests that a single receptor blockade is not sufficient to block PGE2 responses, hence EP2 receptor should be investigated as a potential drug target for the treatment of migraine. The absence of headache during the PGF2Î± infusion demonstrates that vasodilating properties are necessary for the induction of headache and migraine.",
"In CFAE recordings, the DM parameter was found to have greater temporal morphologic variation in paroxysmal as compared with persistent AF data (p<0.001).

Results of the clinical and laboratory evaluation of the effectiveness of the basic course of treatment are presented. A total of 238 patients, including 32 patients with limited forms of the pulmonary tuberculosis and 206 patients had widespread forms of pulmonary tuberculosis, were randomized into the basic group (BG) and comparison group (CG), where 95 CG patients received only polychemotherapy and 111 BG patients received polychemotherapy with the use of cycloferon. Data on the initial levels of cytokines (IFN-gamma and IL-4) in healthy persons and patients with various spread ofa tubercular inflammation in lungs are presented and compared. It is established that, in patients with widespread forms, initially low level of IFN-gamma and high concentration IL-4 (in comparison with the limited forms) shows a severe disbalance between Th1- and Th2-mediated immune response. The administration of cycloferon in the complex therapy of patients with widespread forms leads to an increase in the IFN-gamma concentration at initially low levels (below median level of this cytokine in healthy humans). Activation of the Th1-mediated immune response upon using cycloferon leads to an early elimination of clinical manifestations of the intoxication syndrome, positive roentgenological dynamics, conversion of sputum smear, and successful outcomes of treatment.",

"Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) offers tomographic images of the coronary artery, helping physicians to refine drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation in angiographically complex lesions. However, controversy exists regarding whether the routine use of IVUS in short-length lesions leads to improved clinical outcomes after DES implantation. Therefore, we evaluated the usefulness of IVUS in predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization, at 1 year after DES implantation in short-length lesions. The present study was a subanalysis of the REal Safety and Efficacy of a 3-month dual antiplatelet Therapy following Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stent implantation (RESET) study with different clinical outcome parameters. The study population consisted of 662 patients with IVUS guidance and 912 patients with angiography guidance who underwent DES implantation (stent length â¤24 mm). In the IVUS-guided group, adjuvant postdilation was more frequently performed (43.0% vs 34.6%, p <0.001), and the postintervention minimal lumen diameters were greater (2.88 Â± 0.44 mm vs 2.72 Â± 0.43 mm, p <0.001). MACE occurred in 15 IVUS-guided (2.3%) and 19 angiographically guided (2.1%) patients (p = 0.872). In a subset of patients with diabetes mellitus (n = 292), the MACE rate was 3.4% (n = 4) and 1.7% (n = 3) in the IVUS- and angiographically guided patients, respectively (p = 0.384). The MACE rate in the IVUS- and angiographically guided patients with acute coronary syndrome (n = 601) was 1.1% (n = 3) and 2.7% (n = 9), respectively (p = 0.194). The clinical benefits of IVUS-guided DES implantation compared with angiographically guided DES implantation in short-length lesions could not be confirmed even in patients with clinically high-risk presentations (acute coronary syndrome and diabetes mellitus). In conclusion, routine IVUS guidance does not provide clinical benefits when performing short-length DES implantation.",

"The simultaneous occurrence of cancer and coronary heart disease is increasing in the Western world. Nevertheless, the influence of cancer on ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has not been investigated extensively. This multicenter registry included patients with STEMI treated with primary PCI from 2006 to 2009. Patients were stratified according to history of cancer, and primary focus lay on all-cause and cardiac mortalities during 1-year follow-up. Adjusted effect sizes were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. In total, 208 patients had a history of cancer (diagnosed â¤6Â months ago in 20.7%, 6 months to 3 years ago in 21.7%, and >3Â years ago in 57.6%) and 3,215 patients had no history of cancer. Chemotherapy had been administered previously to 23% of patients with cancer. Patients with cancer were older, more frequently women, and more commonly known with previous myocardial infarction or anemia. Reperfusion rates were similar after PCI. Patients with cancer showed greater all-cause (17.4% vs 6.5% in other patients) and cardiac mortalities at 1 year (10.7% vs 5.4% in other patients) because of high early cardiac death (23.8%) in recently diagnosed patients with cancer. After adjustment, a recent cancer diagnosis predicted cardiac mortality at 7 days (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% confidence interval 1.57 to 7.08). The adverse prognosis was partly explained by anemia and occurrence of cardiogenic shock, whereas outcome was independent of cancer treatment. In conclusion, patients with cancer showed greater mortality after STEMI. A cancer diagnosis in the 6Â months before primary PCI was strongly associated with early cardiac mortality.",

"Radical cure of Plasmodium vivax infection applies blood schizontocidal therapy against the acute attack and hypnozoitocidal therapy against later relapse. Chloroquine and primaquine have been used for 60 years in this manner. Resistance to chloroquine by the parasite now requires partnering other blood schizontocides with primaquine. However, the safety and efficacy of primaquine against relapse when combined with other drugs have not been demonstrated. This randomized, open-label, and relapse-controlled trial estimated the efficacy of primaquine against relapse when administered with quinine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for treatment of the acute infection. Among 650 soldiers who had returned to their malaria-free base in Java, Indonesia, after 12 months in malarious Papua, Indonesia, 143 with acute P. vivax malaria were eligible for study. One hundred sixteen enrolled subjects were randomized to these treatments: artesunate (200-mg dose followed by 100 mg/day for 6 days), quinine (1.8 g/day for 7 days) plus concurrent primaquine (30 mg/day for 14 days), or dihydroartemisinin (120 mg) plus piperaquine (960 mg) daily for 3 days followed 25 days later by primaquine (30 mg/day for 14 days). Follow-up was for 12 months. One hundred thirteen subjects were analyzable.

The efficacy of primaquine against relapse was 92% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 81% to 96%) for quinine plus primaquine and 98% (95% CI = 91% to 99%) for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus primaquine. Antirelapse therapy with primaquine begun a month after treatment of the acute attack with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine proved safe and highly efficacious against relapse by P. vivax acquired in Papua, Indonesia.",

The overall sensitivity regarding malignant disease in central and peripheral pulmonary lesions was 67.0%. In 71 patients with suspected malignancy and a negative PTNB, the examination was repeated and the sensitivity was increased to 79.5%. Each needle had the following sensitivity: NordenstrÃ¶m 67.4%, Vacu-Cut 75.7%, FranzÃ©n 75.9%. The overall pneumothorax frequency was 24.7%, being highest with the NordenstrÃ¶m needle.

"In an open-label 12-week study, the safety and efficacy of bimatoprost 0.03% was evaluated in 55 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension inadequately controlled by topical beta-blocker monotherapy. Patients discontinued their topical beta-blocker therapy at the baseline visit and began bimatoprost monotherapy that evening. Study visits were at 6 and 12 weeks postbaseline. Bimatoprost reduced intraocular pressure (IOP) 4.5 mm Hg (21.5%; P < .001) from baseline at week 6 and 4.2 mm Hg (19.6%; P < .001) at week 12. Patients were more likely to achieve low target pressures with bimatoprost than with topical beta-blockers. Conjunctival hyperemia was the most commonly reported adverse event. The findings from this study indicate bimatoprost monotherapy provides a substantially greater IOP reduction than topical beta-blocker therapy and allows more patients to achieve a low target pressure. Bimatoprost is an effective alternative to topical beta-blockers for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension.",

"The analysis of our sample shows that the arrhythmogenic condition is not only provided from diabetic condition per se but it is enhanced in PGC. Infact PGC patients showed higher number of VEBs, often polymorphic, expression of more severe arrhythmic and cardiovascular outcome.

"One third of the world's population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and with the lifestyle changes succeeding the on-going urbanization, populations already burdened by tuberculosis are experiencing a dramatic increase in chronic diseases, with diabetes being a serious challenge. Tuberculosis and diabetes are not only becoming co-existing diseases. In fact, the diseases interact, and there is evidence to suggest that especially diabetes disease increases the susceptibility for developing active tuberculosis disease. Furthermore, it is plausible that tuberculosis leads to, either transient or permanent, impairment of the glucose metabolism, which ultimately will turn into diabetes. A number of studies from the Americas, Europe, Asia, and, most lately, from sub-Saharan Africa have reported strong association between tuberculosis and diabetes; on average, the estimated risk of active tuberculosis is thrice as high among people with diabetes. The study from sub-Saharan Africa was conducted in Tanzania and is the basis of this thesis. Based on available evidence on the association between tuberculosis and diabetes, the primary aim of the study was to assess the role of diabetes for tuberculosis risk, manifestations, treatment outcomes and survival in a Tanzanian population of tuberculosis patients and non-tuberculosis neighbourhood controls. The study was conducted in Mwanza City in northern Tanzania, with a population exceeding half a million inhabitants, with tuberculosis and HIV being common infections in the region, but with little knowledge about the prevalence of diabetes. We recruited newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients from spring 2006 and continuously till the fall 2009, with all participating in a nutritional intervention running in parallel with the medical tuberculosis treatment. All participants underwent diabetes and HIV testing as well as a series of measurements such as anthropometric, clinical and paraclinical parameters. The population was followed up during treatment (2 and 5 months) to assess treatment outcome as well as after one year to assess their survival status. Based on data from 1,250 tuberculosis patients and 350 neighbourhood controls, we found that 38 and 21%, respectively, had impaired glycaemia, and that the prevalence of diabetes was 17 and 9% among tuberculosis patients and controls, respectively. This difference in prevalence between patients and controls was equivalent to an adjusted odds ratio of more than four, indicating a strong association between tuberculosis and diabetes. Furthermore, we found that diabetes was associated with tuberculosis among both participants with or without HIV co-infection. Despite the strong association, diabetes had only moderate clinical implications when the tuberculosis patients initiated the tuberculosis treatment; the patients with diabetes co-morbidity had a minor elevation in the immune response and more frequently reported to have fever. Furthermore, diabetes did not seem to delay time to sputum conversion during treatment. Nevertheless, diabetes co-morbidity led to impaired treatment outcome with slower recovery of weight and haemoglobin and a more than four times higher mortality rate within the initial phase of tuberculosis treatment. In conclusion, in the African region, the double burden of tuberculosis and diabetes is becoming a major health problem. Although the tuberculosis incidence has stabilized during the last decade, the increasing incidence of diabetes will possibly interfere with tuberculosis control and may, consequently, make the tuberculosis incidence increase again. Future research strategies should focus on enhanced diagnostic tools to identify tuberculosis patients with diabetes co-morbidity, and on the role of disease-disease, drug-disease and drug-drug interactions between tuberculosis and diabetes diseases and treatments.",

When the trial ended, 14 of the 21 subjects reported that the headache attacks had decreased by more than 50% in respect to baseline and 4 of them reported having no headache attacks. After receiving melatonin for one month one subject dropped out because of excessive daytime sleepiness. Our promising results warrant randomized placebo-controlled trials in children to assess the real effectiveness of melatonin in preventing primary headache.",

"Pheochromocytomas arise sporadically and as a component tumor of the inherited cancer syndromes von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), and type 1 neurofibromatosis. Germline mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene (VHL) are responsible for VHL, and germline RET protooncogene mutations are associated with MEN 2. The present study was conducted to examine a large series of 36 VHL-related pheochromocytomas for somatic VHL and RET gene alterations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of markers on chromosome arms 1p, 3p, and 22q. For comparison, the same analyses were performed in 17 sporadic pheochromocytomas. We found no somatic intragenic mutations within VHL and RET in any VHL or sporadic pheochromocytoma, and no pheochromocytoma demonstrated upstream VHL gene hypermethylation. Of interest, we found significantly different LOH frequencies at 3 loci between sporadic and VHL tumors; the more than 91% LOH of markers on 3p and the relatively low frequencies of LOH at 1p and 22q (15% and 21%, respectively) in VHL pheochromocytomas argue for the importance of VHL gene dysregulation and dysfunction in the pathogenesis of almost all VHL pheochromocytomas. In contrast, the relatively low frequency of 3p LOH (24%; P: << 0.0001) and the lack of intragenic VHL alterations compared with the high frequency of 1p LOH (71%; P: = 0.0003) and the moderate frequency of 22q LOH (53%) in sporadic pheochromocytomas argue for genes other than VHL, especially on 1p, that are significant for sporadic tumorigenesis and suggest that the genetic pathways involved in sporadic vs. VHL pheochromocytoma genesis are distinct.",
"This study investigates the release of Neuropeptide Y from eight human pheochromocytomas. Profil immunoreactive Neuropeptide Y (Ir-NPY) levels during the management of surgery were compared with these of norepinephrine (NE) while hemodynamics were monitored. Plasma IrNPY and NE levels increased during tumor manipulation and returned to near normal one hour after operation. However, Ir-NPY levels remained high just after tumor resection while NE levels were significantly decreased. At tumor manipulation and just after tumor resection, plasma Ir-NPY levels were correlated with the systemic vascular resistances (SVR) (r = 0.74; P<0.04 and r = 0.86; P<0.006 respectively). No correlation was found either between plasma Ir-NPY and NE levels or between plasma NE levels and SVR. The release of Ir-NPY from tumor tissue, studied by a superfusion method, exhibited a significant correlation with the plasma Ir-NPY concentrations at the time of corresponding tumor resection (r = 0.95; P<0.007). Chromatographic analysis showed that Ir-NPY in plasma and outflow migrate as human NPY (1-36). These results confirmed that in pheochromocytoma, plasma NPY mainly originates from the tumor and argue for an important role of NPY in pheochromocytoma hypertension as indicated by the correlation between the Ir-NPY levels and the SVR.",

"We carried out a multicenter randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surfactant in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome. The study population was made up of newborn infants weighing 750 to 1750 g who were receiving assisted ventilation with 40 percent or more oxygen. The eligible infants received a single dose of either surfactant (100 mg of phospholipid per kilogram of body weight [4 ml per kilogram]) or an air placebo (4 ml per kilogram), administered into the trachea within eight hours of birth by an investigator not involved in the clinical care of the infant. When compared with the infants who received the placebo (n = 81), the infants who were treated with surfactant (n = 78) had a 0.12 greater average increase in the ratio of arterial to alveolar oxygen tension (P less than 0.0001), a 0.20 greater average decrease in the fractional inspiratory oxygen concentration (P less than 0.0001), and a 0.26-kPa greater average decrease in the mean airway pressure (P less than 0.0001) during the 72 hours after treatment. Pneumothorax was less frequent among the infants treated with surfactant than in the control group (13 percent vs. 37 percent; P = 0.0005). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the proportion of infants in each of five ordered clinical-status categories on day 7 (P = 0.08) or day 28 (P = 0.75) after treatment. There were also no significant differences between the groups in the frequency of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis, or periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage. In each group, 17 percent of the infants died by day 28. We conclude that treatment with the single-dose surfactant regimen used in this study reduces the severity of respiratory distress during the 72 hours after treatment and decreases the frequency of pneumothorax, but that it does not significantly improve clinical status later in the neonatal period and does not reduce neonatal mortality. Further study of different surfactant regimens and patient-selection criteria will be required to determine whether this initial improvement can be translated into reductions in mortality or serious morbidity.",

"The authors examined the ability of antioxidants to prevent in vitro oxidant damage to the sickle red blood cell (RBC). One millimolar ascorbic acid and alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine significantly (p less than 0.005) protected against RBC Heinz body formation during incubation with acetylphenylhydrazine, while cysteine, cysteamine, and methionine did not. The effect of ascorbic acid was concentration dependent with concentrations as low as 0.1 mM having significant antioxidant effects. Ascorbic acid protected the RBC against hydrogen peroxide induced hemolysis as well (p less than 0.05). Ascorbic acid had a significant stimulatory effect on the rate of glucose oxidation by the pentose phosphate shunt (PPS), especially in the sickle RBC. Ascorbic acid did not protect the RBC from a patient with chronic hemolytic anemia due to G6PDTorrance from Heinz body formation, suggesting that an intact PPS is necessary for ascorbic acid to express its antioxidant properties. These data suggest that clinical trials should be undertaken to examine the efficacy of ascorbic acid in the treatment of SCD.",

"Patients with chronic migraine (CM) and medication overuse (MO) have high frequency of psychiatric comorbidity. Aims of this open label, prospective, independent study were: to evaluate the efficacy of duloxetine in a sample of patients with MO due to CM and with concomitant depression; to investigate, if the presence of OCD influences the outcome in this subgroup of patients. A total of 50 consecutive patients (40 F,10 M, aged 20-65 years, mean 39.4 years) from those attending our Headache Center to undergo an inpatient withdrawal programme followed by anti-migraine prophylaxis was enrolled. After a 1-month baseline period, all patients were prescribed duloxetine 30 mg in the morning for the first week, and 60 mg for the following 12 weeks. They filled a daily headache diary during the whole study period. They also completed Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) and migraine disability assessment scale (MIDAS) at baseline and at the 12-week follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of responders, i.e. of patients with a reduction â¥50 % in headache frequency as well as in symptomatic drug consumption. Comparison between patients with and without OCD was performed. Our results showed a rather high responder rate in the total sample (64 %), while none of the patients with OCD fell among responders. MIDAS and HDRS scores had a more evident decrease in patients without OSD. These findings suggest that duloxetine may be effective in patients with MO due to CM and with comorbid depression. They also confirm the importance of a systematic assessment of the psychopathological profile in these patients, and indicate that clinicians should be aware of the relevant prognostic role of OCD in favoring a poor outcome and persistent disability in headache patients with MO.",

"A randomised, double blind trial was carried out in 16 patients undergoing pleurectomy to assess the effect of continuous extrapleural intercostal block on postoperative pain and pulmonary function. Subjective pain relief was assessed on a linear visual analogue scale. Pulmonary function was measured on the day before operation and daily for five days after surgery. Eight patients received bupivacaine and eight placebo (saline). The mean pain scores at 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours were 13.3, 8.5, 6.1, and 10 mm respectively in the bupivacaine group compared with 56.3, 41, 46.7, and 35 in the control group; in addition, the bupivacaine group required less papaveretum. Twenty four hours after surgery mean values of peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced vital capacity were reduced to 82%, 76%, and 76% of preoperative control values in the bupivacaine group, and to 39%, 32%, and 36% in the control group. The speed of recovery of pulmonary function was superior in the bupivacaine group. There were no complications related to the infusion. Continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve blockade with bupivacaine provides safe and effective postoperative analgesia and improves respiratory mechanics after pleurectomy.",

"Recently, we reported that angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), valsartan, and calcium channel blocker (CCB), amlodipine, had similar effects on the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in diabetic hypertensive patients. We assessed the difference of cardiovascular protective effects between ARB and CCB in patients with and without previous CVD, respectively. A total of 1,150 Japanese diabetic hypertensive patients were randomized to either valsartan or amlodipine treatment arms, which were additionally divided into 2 groups according to the presence of previous CVD at baseline (without CVD, nÂ = 818; with CVD, nÂ = 332). The primary composite outcomes were sudden cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for heart failure. The incidence of primary end point events in patients with previous CVD was 3.5-times greater than that in patients without previous CVD (64.1 vs 17.9/1,000 person-years). The ARB- and the CCB-based treatment arms showed similar incidence of composite CVD events in both patients without previous CVD (hazard ratio [HR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 2.40) and those with previous CVD (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.31). The ARB-treatment arm showed less incidence of stroke compared with the CCB-based treatment arm in patients with previous CVD (HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.11, pÂ = 0.068), whereas the 2 treatment arms showed similar incidence of stroke in patients without previous CVD (HR 1.52, 95% CI 0.59 to 3.91). In conclusion, the ARB- and the CCB-based treatments exerted similar protective effects of CVD events regardless of the presence of previous CVD. For stroke events, the ARB may have more protective effects than the CCB in diabetic hypertensive patients with previous CVD.",

Group 2â¶12 adults, stable on ART, with CD4 counts >300, and an undetectable HIV RNA load. Safety was evaluated by occurrence of local and systemic adverse events (AEs) and by monitoring of CD4 count, HIV RNA load, haematology and biochemistry. Immunogenicity was evaluated by ex-vivo interferon-gamma ELISpot assay. 87.7% of AEs were mild; 11.6% were moderate; and 0.7% were severe. 29.2% of AEs were systemic; 70.8% were expected local AEs. There were no vaccine-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or clinically significant effects on HIV RNA load or CD4 count. In ART naive subjects, the first MVA85A immunisation induced a significant immune response at 1 and 4 weeks post-immunisation, which contracted to baseline by 12 weeks. Durability of immunogenicity in subjects on ART persisted out to 24 weeks post-vaccination. A second dose of MVA85A at 12 months enhanced immunogenicity in ART naÃ¯ve subjects. Subjects on ART had higher responses after the first vaccination compared with ART naÃ¯ve subjects; responses were comparable after 2 immunisations. In conclusion, MVA85A is well-tolerated and immunogenic in HIV-infected subjects in Senegal. A two dose regimen in ART naÃ¯ve subjects is comparable in immunogenicity to a single dose in subjects on ART. Clinicaltrials.gov trial identifier NCT00731471.",

"Hepcidin levels are high and iron absorption is limited in acute malaria. The mechanism(s) that regulate hepcidin secretion remain undefined. We have measured hepcidin concentration and cytokines in 100 Kenyan children with acute falciparum malaria and different degrees of anemia. Hepcidin was increased on admission and fell significantly one week and one month after treatment. The association of hepcidin with hemoglobin was not linear and hepcidin was very low in severe malarial anemia. Parasite density, IL-10 and IL-6 were significantly associated with hepcidin concentration. Hepcidin response to acute malaria supports the notion of iron sequestration during acute malaria infection and suggests that iron administration during acute malaria is futile. These data suggest iron supplementation policies should take into account the high hepcidin levels and probable poor utilization of iron for up to one week after treatment for the majority of patients with acute malaria.",

However, few have evaluated EEG findings in migraineurs during a time period when neither the last attack nor the next attack may interact with the results. We, therefore, compared interictal EEG in migraineurs and headache-free subjects with a design controlled for interference by pre-ictal changes. Pre-ictal EEG findings in the painful cranial side during the next attack after registration were also investigated. Correlations between clinical variables and EEG are reported as well. Interictal EEGs from 33 migraineurs (6 with and 27 without aura) and 31 controls were compared. Absolute power, asymmetry and relative power were studied for delta, theta and alpha frequency bands in parieto-occipital, temporal and fronto-central areas. EEG variables were correlated to attack frequency, headache duration, attack duration, pain intensity, photo- and phonophobia. Compared with controls, migraineurs had increased relative theta power in all cortical regions and increased delta activity in the painful fronto-central region. Absolute power and asymmetry were similar among groups. In age-adjusted analyses, headache intensity correlated with increased delta activity. In this blinded controlled study, we found globally increased relative theta activity in migraineurs. A slight interictal brain dysfunction is probably present between attacks.",

"The current guidelines most strongly support cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for patients with heart failure with a QRS width of â¥150 ms and left bundle branch block (LBBB). Our objective was to assess the potential benefit of echocardiographically guided left ventricular (LV) lead positioning for patients with a QRS width <150 ms or non-LBBB as a substudy of the Speckle Tracking Assisted Resynchronization Therapy for Electrode Region (STARTER) prospective, randomized controlled trial. The STARTER trial randomized 187 patients with heart failure, a QRS of â¥120 ms, and ejection fraction of â¤35% to LV lead guided to the site of latest mechanical activation by speckle tracking radial strain versus routine implantation. The predefined primary end point was heart failure hospitalization or death within 2 years. This substudy included 151 CRT patients with matching echocardiographic and LV lead position data and complete follow-up data. Patients with a QRS width of 120 to 149 ms or non-LBBB and LV lead concordant or adjacent to the site of latest mechanical activation had favorable outcomes after CRT similar to those with LBBB or a QRS width of â¥150 ms. In contrast, patients with a QRS of 120 to 149 ms or non-LBBB and remote LV leads had unfavorable outcomes (hazard ratio 5.45, 95% confidence interval 2.36 to 12.6, p <0.001, and hazard ratio 4.92, 95% confidence interval 2.12 to 11.39, p <0.001, respectively, with significant interaction after adjusting for baseline variables, p = 0.038 and p = 0.008).

Beyond conventional antiarrhythmic agents such as amiodarone, local anesthetics, tranquilizers, anticonvulsants, and neuroleptics exhibit antiarrhythmic properties. H(1)-histamine receptor blockers are widely used in treating allergies in children. Observational studies suggest efficacy of these agents for treating or preventing tachyarrhythmias, although prolongation of QT interval, and ventricular arrhythmias occur. We determined safety and efficacy of antihistamine, quifenadine, versus conventional amiodarone on cardiac rhythm in children with frequent premature beats (PB). One hundred and four patients (mean age 10.8 +/- 3.2 years) with ventricular (n = 65), supraventricular (n = 39) PB were randomized 1:1 to quifenadine (2 mg kg(-1) day(-1); n = 54), or amiodarone (9 mg kg(-1) day(-1), n = 50) arms. Both groups were treated for 2 weeks. All patients underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring 3 times: before at 14-28 days after randomization, and during the follow up at 2-3 months. The mean frequency of PB in quifenadine group was 562 +/- 61 per hour and 597 +/- 78 per hour in the amiodarone-treated children. Full antiarrhythmic efficacy (PB < 75% from baseline) has been achieved in 23/54 (43%) of quifenadine-treated patients, which was less than after amiodarone treatment (37/50, 74%, P = 0.02). Quifenadine was mostly beneficial in children with supraventricular PB and/or bradycardia than in those with ventricular PB; it was associated with a trend toward increased heart rate during day (88.5 +/- 8.4 beats/min) and night (67.3 +/- 6.2) compared with amiodarone (79.6 +/- 7.8 and 56.1 +/- 5.7 beats/min, respectively; P = 0.04). The incidence of side effects in quifenadine group (drowsiness and headache) was low (2%) in contrast to the alarming 40% risk associated with amiodarone therapy. Quifanidine exhibits antiarrhythmic activity in children with frequent PB, without significant QT prolongation, or sinus node depression. Although, H(1)-histamine receptor blocker is less potent than amiodarone, much better safety profile of quifenadine is advantageous, especially in children. Future large trials with proving novel antihistamines pleiotropy are warranted.",

"The aim of present study was to compare the efficacy and safety of fixed combination of brimonidine and timolol with individual components used as monotherapy in patients of primary open angle glaucoma. Patients were randomly assigned to receive brimonidine or timolol or brimonidine-timolol fixed combination, with 30 patients in each group. The mean reduction in intraocular pressure in brimonidine, timolol, and brimonidine-timolol group were 4.29 Â± 1.97 mm Hg, 4.34 Â± 1.21 mm Hg, and 5.54 Â± 1.87 mm Hg respectively at 2 weeks and 4.86 Â± 1.16 mm Hg, 5.42 Â± 1.50 mm Hg, and 7.36 Â± 2.58 mm Hg respectively at 6 weeks. When values of mean reduction in intraocular pressure were compared between brimonidine-timolol fixed combination with brimonidine and timolol, it was found to be statistically significant ( P < 0.05) at 2 weeks and highly significant (0.001) at 6 weeks.

"The aim of the study was to evaluate quantitatively ictal and interictal phonophobia in episodic migraine (EM). We included subjects with EM and age- and gender-matched controls. Sound stimuli were pure tones at frequencies of 1000, 4000 and 8000 Hz. Sound aversion thresholds (SATs) were determined as the minimal sound intensity perceived as unpleasant or painful. Migraineurs were examined both between and during attacks. We compared interictal SATs in migraineurs with those in controls. We also compared ictal and interictal SATs in migraineurs. Sixty migraineurs and 52 controls were included. Interictal mean SAT of migraineurs, averaged for the three frequencies, was significantly lower than that of controls [90.4 (0.8) dB vs. 105.9 (1.1) dB, respectively, P < 0.0001]. In migraineurs, mean ictal SAT, averaged for the three frequencies, was significantly lower than interictal SAT [76.0 (0.9) dB vs. 91.0 (0.8) dB, respectively, P < 0.0001]. Patients with EM exhibit increased sound aversion between attacks that is further augmented during an acute attack.",

"Apical ballooning syndrome (ABS), migraine, and Raynaud phenomenon are characterized by female predominance, identifiable triggers, and, likely, vascular dysfunction. Estrogen deficiency, such as in menopause, is considered to be a predisposing factor for ABS. We investigated the association of ABS with migraine, Raynaud phenomenon, and hormonal factors. We compared 25 consecutive residents (all women) of Olmsted County, Minnesota, presenting with ABS, to 2 age-matched control groups from the same community: 25 women presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), matched for the index ABS event date, and 50 women with neither diagnosis. The patients with ABS were more likely to have a migraine history (11 [44%] vs 4 [16%] STEMI controls, p = 0.031, and vs 6 [12%] population controls, p = 0.003), and "possible migraine" (including other headache syndromes suggestive of migraine; 15 [60%] vs 6 [24%] STEMI controls, p = 0.012; and vs 12 [24%] population controls, p = 0.003). Of the patients with ABS, 4 (16%) had Raynaud phenomenon compared to no STEMI controls and 1 (2%) population control (p = 0.038). No differences were present in parity, menopausal status, years since the onset of menopause, and frequency of oophorectomy. Current hormonal replacement therapy use was greater in those with ABS than in the population controls: 4 (16%) versus none (p = 0.002). In conclusion, the association of ABS with migraine and Raynaud phenomenon supports a role of vasomotor dysfunction in the pathogenesis of ABS. The absence of an association with reproductive characteristics and the finding that ABS occurred despite exogenous hormonal use in some patients suggests that estrogen deficiency per se is not the primary factor in the pathophysiology.",
"Amiodarone and sotalol facilitated successful electrocardioversion, which could be achieved in a stepwise fashion. Upon achievement of successful electrocardioversion, amiodarone is superior to placebo, and sotalol has a lesser effect. Antiarrhythmic drugs had no effect on the total number of energy step use in patients who had successful electrocardioversion. Calcium channel blockers had no influence on the success rate in achieving sinus rhythm. Successful electrocardioversion was associated with lower BMI and AF history < or =1 year.

"Malaria was expected to be a major problem during blood donation in Turkey due to existence of malaria cases in southeastern region of Turkey. The present study aimed for the first time, to investigate malaria in "donors deferred for malaria risk" and to determine the regional rates of malaria deferral in Turkey. Blood samples were collected from several Blood Banks of southeastern provinces where local malaria cases still exist and from Blood Bank of Ege University Medical School (EUMS) located in western Turkey where malaria is eradicated decades ago. Plasmodium spp. and specific antibodies were investigated by stained smears, antigen detection, PCR and ELISA. Among the donors deferred for malaria risk, Plasmodium spp. were not detected by microscopy, PCR or antigen detection. Seroprevalances were 2% and 3.92% in western and southeastern regions, respectively. Rate of donor deferral for malaria risk was 0.9% in EUMS and deferrals were exclusively because of travel to southeastern Turkey. In southeastern provinces, deferrals were mainly due to malaria like fever history. The present study first time assessed regional rates of donor deferral due to malaria risk in Turkey. Previously, malaria was expected to be a major problem during blood donation in Turkey due to existence of malaria cases in southeastern region of Turkey. The results of the study showed that 97% of the deferrals were unnecessary. In conclusion, to reduce unnecessary donor deferrals in Turkey, in addition to comprehensive questioning for malaria history, the usage of a malaria antibody screening method should be initiated prior to deferral decision.",

"This study assesses the surgical stress of laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) in patients with pheochromocytoma using catecholamine and cytokine. The study was conducted on one patient who had laparoscopic adrenalectomy performed for pheochromocytoma, and three patients as controls who had undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for cholecystolithiasis. Catecholamines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured at 30-minute intervals intraoperatively, and on the first, third and fifth postoperative days (POD) respectively. Plasma TNFalpha and IL-6 were measured by a commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. During the operation. changes of catecholamine concentration in LA were far larger than those in LC. The changes of TNFalpha concentration in LA were also larger than those in LC. TNFalpha returned to basal value at the end of the operation in LC, but it did not in LA. TNFalpha concentration in LC changed a little after the surgery, whereas that in LA sharply increased and was maintained at a high level from 1 POD until 5 POD. Enhanced cytokine responses were observed in LA compared to LC during and after the surgery. We concluded that laparoscopic adrenalectomy may give those patients with pheochromocytoma more surgical stress than laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystolithiasis, during and after the operation.",

"We evaluated a hypothesis that thrombus aspiration with distal protection is superior to simple thrombus aspiration in patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 176 consecutive patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction were enrolled in this study and assigned to either the thrombus aspiration group (A, nÂ = 104) or the thrombus aspiration with distal protection group using a filter device system (AÂ + DP, nÂ = 72). We compared the angiographic reperfusion grade, left ventricular (LV) function, and clinical outcomes between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in age, gender distribution, the onset-to-reperfusion time, the peak levels of creatine kinase, or 6-month mortality between the 2 groups. The rate of achieving a Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade of 3 and a myocardial blush grade of 3 was higher in the AÂ + DP group than in the A group. Among the patients who underwent follow-up catheterization 6 months after PCI (A, nÂ = 62; AÂ + DP, nÂ = 52), there were no significant differences in the LV end-diastolic volume index, LV end-systolic volume index, or LV ejection fraction between the 2 groups at the time of PCI or 6 months after PCI. In conclusion, thrombus aspiration with distal protection may be more effective in initially restoring the coronary blood flow than thrombus aspiration alone, although it may not be superior to thrombus aspiration in preventing LV remodeling or preserving the LV function in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.",

"Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) affects most women during their reproductive life. Headache is regarded as a typical symptom of PMS and, close to menses, migrainous women could experience their worst migraine attacks. Vitex agnus-castus (VAC) is a phytopharmaceutical compound, considered worldwide to be a valid tool to treat PMS. Aim of this study is to explore if headache is ameliorate in migrainous women treated with VAC for PMS by an open-label clinical observation. Migrainous women with PMS were enrolled in the study and advised to assume a treatment with VAC (40Â mg/day) for PMS for a 3-month period. Effects both on PMS and headache were assessed. Out of 107 women, 100 completed the 3-month treatment for PMS. Out of them, 66 women reported a dramatic reduction of PMS symptoms, 26 a mild reduction, and 8 no effect. Concerning migraine, 42Â % of patients experienced a reduction higher than 50Â % in frequency of monthly attacks, and 57Â % of patients experienced a reduction higher than 50Â % in monthly days with headache. No patients reported remarkable side effects. Pending a placebo-controlled trial to confirm our results, we observed that the use of VAC in migrainous women affected by PMS resulted to be safe and well tolerated, and may positively influence the frequency and duration of migraine attacks.",

"ABPM (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) has been considered to be a useful tool for the diagnosis and management of arterial hypertension and is a better predictor of future cardiovascular events as compared with conventional office-based BP measurements. Despite its potential values, ABPM is not yet widely used in many clinical offices mainly because of lack of knowledge and unavailability. Aims of this preliminary study are to determine the control of hypertension and circadian BP characteristics in patients referred to our Centre whom we enrolled in the "HRKMAT" Study-Croatian Registry of ABPM. Although patients included in HRKMAT Study had other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, in this paper we analyzed differences between hypertensive diabetics (N = 20) and nondiabetics (N = 57). 24-hours ABPM was performed with an automated oscillometric device Mobil-O-Graph NG Vers.20 and office BP using mercury sphygmomanometer. Average office BP was 139/90 mmHg, and average 24h ABPM was 130/82 mmHg. Majority of hypertensive patients used antihypertensive drugs (79.2%). Diabetic patients had higher systolic BP but lower diastolic BP. There were no statistically significant differences in dipping status, but earlier BP surge was noticed in reverse diabetic dippers than in reverse non-diabetic dippers. Though no significant, there was higher prevalence of WCH ("white coat hypertension") in diabetics, and we found MH (masked hypertension) in only two patients. These are preliminary results on ABPM from our centre and of HRKMAT registry. Further and more valuable data and results are awaited from the main HRKMAT database.",

"Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have a higher incidence of infections, and those with bacteremia are more prone to develop sepsis and infective endocarditis (IE). Nevertheless, data concerning the impact of DM on the prognosis of patients with IE are limited and sometimes contradictory. We examined the impact of DM on the inhospital outcome of left-sided IE in a large cohort of patients. We studied 594 consecutive episodes of left-sided IE diagnosed at 3 tertiary care centers. They were divided into 2 groups: episodes in patients with DM (n = 114) and episodes in patients without DM (n = 480). We retrospectively analyzed the influence of DM therapy on patient outcome. Compared to patients without DM, patients with DM were older (67 Â± 10 vs. 60 Â± 15 yr; p < 0.001), less frequently male (53.5% vs. 67.9%; p = 0.004), and more commonly had chronic renal failure (23.9% vs. 6.9%; p < 0.001) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.6% vs. 7.8%; p = 0.019). Enterococcus (14.9% vs. 7.4%; p = 0.011) and Streptococcus bovis (8.8% vs. 3.8%; p = 0.024) were isolated more frequently. In the univariable analysis, septic shock (29.2% vs. 16.4%; p = 0.005) and mortality (43.5% vs. 30.0%; p = 0.008) were more common among patients with DM than in those without. Considering the different treatments for DM, septic shock (33.3%; p = 0.011) and death (50.8%; p = 0.012) were more frequent in patients receiving oral medication to treat diabetes than in patients with the other treatment modalities. However, multivariable analysis showed that DM had an independent association with development of septic shock (OR 2.282; 95% CI 1.186-4.393), but it was not a predictor of inhospital mortality.Staphylococci were the most frequently involved microorganisms in all patients; however, Enterococcus and Streptococcus bovis were more frequently isolated from individuals with DM and left-sided IE, whereas viridans group streptococci were more commonly isolated from those with left-sided IE who did not have DM. DM was independently associated with the development of septic shock, but it was not an independent predictor of inhospital mortality in patients with left-sided IE.",

Pharmacokinetic results show that oral topiramate is completely absorbed and that its steady-state elimination half-life is longer than previously assumed, which permits once or twice daily dosing even in the presence of enzyme-inducing drugs. The information from this study can inform the design of subsequent studies in adults, older children, and newborns, including controlled clinical trials intended to determine the efficacy and safety of intravenous topiramate for neonatal seizures.",

"The plasma level of adiponectin (CAS 1070484-33-1), known as an anti-atherogenic adipocytokine, inversely correlates with the progression of atherosclerosis. The reported effects of statins on the serum level of adiponectin include significant increases in the adiponectin levels caused by pravastatin (CAS 81131-70-6). In this study, increasing the dosage of pravastatin was investigated to determine whether it had a clearly favorable effect on the adiponectin level in hypercholesterolemic patients. A total of 26 mild hypercholesterolemic and hypertensive patients were enrolled in this study. The patients were initially treated with pravastatin 10 mg/day for 6 months or more, and then increased to pravastatin 20 mg/day. Serum adiponectin, cholesterol fractionated components, and lipoprotein components were evaluated after 6 months. Increasing the dose of pravastatin from 10 to 20 mg/day caused the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to decrease (from 130 to 104 mg/dL, p < 0.001), and thereafter the serum adiponectin levels, particularly the high-molecular-weight adiponectin levels significantly increased (from 10.9 to 12.6 microg/mL, p = 0.022; from 6.6 to 7.6 microg/mL, p = 0.022, respectively). Pravastatin increased the serum adiponectin level after increasing the dosage from 10 to 20 mg/day. It remains possible, however, that the difference was due not only to pharmacologic effects, but also to other specific characteristics such as the subject characteristics, viz.; race, body size, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, etc.",

"A total of 370 laparoscopic adrenalectomies, including 311 transperitoneal (TP) and 59 retroperitoneal (RP) approaches, were performed in nine urologic centers, where the laparoscopic adrenalectomy was first begun independently in Japan, and their affiliated hospitals between January 1992 and September 1996. The clinical diagnoses of those 370 adrenal diseases were primary aldosteronism in 155 patients, Cushing's syndrome in 61. preclinical Cushing's syndrome in 21. pheochromocytoma in 16, nonfunctioning adenoma in 87, complicated cyst in ten, myelolipoma in nine, adrenal cancer in four and other diagnoses in eight (table 1). There was no mortality in this series. Intraoperative complication rate was 33/370 (9%) in total: 26/311(8%) in the TP procedures and 7/59 (12%) in the RP procedures (table 11). Postoperative complication rate was 24/370 (6%) in total: 22/311 (7%) in the TP procedures and 2/59 (3%) in the RP ones (table 111). Conversion rates to open surgery in total, in the TP and in the RP procedures were 13/370 (3.5%), 10/311 (3.2%) and 3/59 (5.1 %). respectively (table IV). Although the RP procedure has a lower morbidity rate compared to the TP procedure, more skill is required to overcome the drawback of the narrow working space and fewer anatomical landmarks.",
"The preparation for phaeochromocytoma surgery is a matter of debate. Pre-operative blockade of alpha-1 receptors is increasingly employed in an attempt to reduce the risk of hypertensive episodes, especially during manipulation of the tumour. In this study, we compared the interest of an almost complete blockade of these receptors by high doses of urapidil in comparison with that of moderate doses of this drug. The study was conducted in two consecutive series of 18 patients, the first treated by a moderate dose, and the second by the highest dose tolerated by the patient. The two groups were comparable in other respects. All patients were operated under laparoscopy by the same surgeon and managed by the same anaesthetist using the same protocol. The number of hypertensive peaks was significantly reduced using the high dose of urapidil, with no more hypotensive episodes after tumour removal in this group. The area under the curve of norepinephrine levels as a function of time was significantly larger with the high doses of urapidil, arguing in favour of a more complete blockade of alpha-1 receptors. Our findings indicate the value of aggressive blockade of alpha-1 receptors in preparation for surgery of phaeochromocytoma.",

"The combination of artemether (ARM) and lumefantrine is currently the first-line treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in mainland Tanzania. While the exposure to lumefantrine has been associated with the probability of adequate clinical and parasitological cure, increasing exposure to artemether and the active metabolite dihydroartemisinin (DHA) has been shown to decrease the parasite clearance time. The aim of this analysis was to describe the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of artemether, dihydroartemisinin, and lumefantrine in African children with uncomplicated malaria. In addition to drug concentrations and parasitemias from 50 Tanzanian children with falciparum malaria, peripheral parasite densities from 11 asymptomatic children were included in the model of the parasite dynamics. The population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of artemether, dihydroartemisinin, and lumefantrine were modeled in NONMEM. The distribution of artemether was described by a two-compartment model with a rapid absorption and elimination through metabolism to dihydroartemisinin. Dihydroartemisinin concentrations were adequately illustrated by a one-compartment model. The pharmacokinetics of artemether was time dependent, with typical oral clearance increasing from 2.6 liters/h/kg on day 1 to 10 liters/h/kg on day 3. The pharmacokinetics of lumefantrine was sufficiently described by a one-compartment model with an absorption lag time. The typical value of oral clearance was estimated to 77 ml/h/kg. The proposed semimechanistic model of parasite dynamics, while a rough approximation of the complex interplay between malaria parasite and the human host, adequately described the early effect of ARM and DHA concentrations on the parasite density in malaria patients. However, the poor precision in some parameters illustrates the need for further data to support and refine this model.",

"Amnion allografts have been used in a number of clinical applications. However, no references of their use in thoracic surgery have been identified. Air leakage, is one of the most common complications in thoracic surgery, resulting from visceral pleura and lung injuries caused intraoperatively, in particular following rethoracotomy. Mechanical and manual sutures are also potential sites of air leakage. The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of human amnion grafts in the treatment of air leakage following thoracic surgery. Deep-frozen, radiation-sterilized (35 kGy) human amnion grafts prepared in the Central Tissue Bank in Warsaw (Poland) were used. The amnion allografts were applied to 20 patients who had surgery: 11 thoracotomies and 9 rethoracotomies were performed (15 resections of 1-12 metastases, 3 lobectomies and 2 residual tumor resections). During lung ventilation the air leakage sites were covered by the amnion flap attached by moderate compression and stabilized by sutures. Air leakage and drainage were measured during the postoperative period. In 80% of the cases, no traces of air leakage was observed. The preliminary results suggest that the application of human amnion grafts may be a safe and effective method for preventing prolonged air leakage after thoracic surgery.",

"Chagas cardiomyopathy is an endemic disease in Latin America. A significant proportion of patients develop atrial fibrillation (AF), which may result in stroke and increased morbidity or mortality. Interatrial block (IAB) has been associated with the development of AF in different clinical scenarios. The aim of our study was to determine whether IAB can predict new-onset AF in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). We conducted a retrospective study of patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and ICDs from 14 centers in Latin America. Demographics, clinical, and device follow-up were collected. Surface electrocardiograms were scanned at 300 dpi and maximized Ã8. Semiautomatic calipers were used to determine P-wave onset and offset. Partial IAB was defined as a P wave of >120 ms and advanced IAB as a P wave of >120 ms with biphasic morphology (Â±) in inferior leads. AF events and ICD therapies were reviewed during follow-up by 2 independent investigators. A total of 80 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 54.6 Â± 10.4 years, and 52 (65%) were male. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 40 Â± 12%. IAB was detected in 15 patients (18.8%), with 8 (10.0%) partial and 7 (8.8%) advanced. During a follow-up of 33 Â± 20 months, 11 patients (13.8%) presented with new AF. IAB (partial + advanced) was strongly associated with new AF (p <0.0001) and inappropriate therapy by the ICD (p = 0.014). In conclusion, IAB (partial + advanced) predicted new-onset AF in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and ICDs.",

"This study was designed to investigate the effects of combined administration of lipoic acid and pyridoxine on albuminuria, oxidative stress, blood pressure, serum advanced glycation end-products, nitric oxide (NO), and endothelin-1 in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Thirty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a supplement group or a placebo group. The patients in the supplement group received 800 mg lipoic acid and 80 mg pyridoxine daily for 12 weeks, whereas the placebo group received corresponding placebos. Urinary albumin, serum malondialdehyde (MDA), and systolic blood pressure decreased significantly in the supplement group compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). Serum NO increased in the supplement group compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05). Serum pentosidine and carboxymethyl lysine decreased significantly in the supplement group at the end of week 12 compared to baseline (p < 0.05). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in mean changes of serum endothelin-1, glucose, and diastolic blood pressure. The present study indicates that combined administration of lipoic acid and pyridoxine improves albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy by reducing oxidative stress, advanced glycation end-products, and systolic blood pressure. The reduction in microalbuminuria may be of benefit in retarding the progression of diabetic nephropathy.",

"Tonabersat is a novel benzopyran derivative that blocks the cortical spreading depression proposed to be associated with migraine attacks. The ability of single oral doses of 15, 25, 40 and 80 mg of tonabersat to relieve the symptoms of moderate to severe migraine was evaluated in 859 migraineurs enrolled in two dose-ranging, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials, one international and the other North American. In the international study, significantly more patients given tonabersat than given placebo experienced relief of headache pain at 2 h (15 mg, 36.8%; 40 mg, 40.7%), the principal efficacy variable, and at 4 h (40 mg, 63.0%) and complete abolition of headache at 4 h (40 mg, 34.3%). None of the primary or secondary efficacy variables indicated significant differences between tonabersat and placebo in the North American study. Tonabersat was generally well tolerated, with dizziness and nausea the most common side-effects. Serious adverse events were uncommon, and no patient withdrew from either study because of adverse events. These results suggest a possible interplay between tonabersat pharmacokinetics (the relatively long time required to reach maximum plasma concentrations) and patient characteristics (previous triptan exposure) in the management of acute migraine attacks. Based on the pharmacokinetics and actions on cortical spreading depression, tonabersat may have potential value in migraine prophylaxis.",

Study participants were randomized to artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) for all treatments of uncomplicated malaria (N = 4,380) as well as TS prophylaxis for different durations. The risks of gametocytemia detected by microscopy in the 28 days after antimalarial therapy were compared using multivariate analyses. The risk of gametocyte detection was significantly higher in patients treated with DP compared with AL (adjusted relative risk = 1.85, P < 0.001) and among children prescribed TS prophylaxis (adjusted relative risk = 1.76, P < 0.001).

Response to 131-MIBG therapy was evaluated by tumor, hormone, and symptomatic relief criteria. The median follow-up was 18 months (2-48 months). The number of 131-MIBG treatments ranged from 1 to 4 (mean: 2.1). The average single dose of 131-MIBG was 5.4 +/- 0.2 GBq (145 +/- 5.0 mCi).

"The photoplethysmography (PPG) signals detected by transesophageal oximetry sensor toward aorta arch (AA), descending aorta (DA), and left ventricle (LV) under the guidance of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) were investigated, and the effects of filter application on PPG signals were evaluated. Eleven cardiac surgical patients were involved. After anesthesia was induced, the TEE probe with a modified pulse oximetry sensor was inserted. Under the guidance of TEE, the AA PPG, DA PPG and LV PPG were detected respectively when ventilator was on and off. The mean alternating current (AC) amplitudes and direct current (DC) values of original and filtered PPG signals were measured. The ratio of AC and DC value (AC/DC) and ventilation-induced AC variations were calculated. Satisfactory PPG waveforms were obtained in all patients under the guidance of TEE. The AC amplitude in LV PPG was significant larger than in AA and DA PPG, and both AC/DC and ventilation-induced AC variation in LV PPG were significantly higher than in AA PPG or DA PPG either. There were no significant differences of AC amplitude between filtered and ventilation off PPG signals. The AC amplitudes and AC/DC toward LV are significantly higher than transesophageal oximeter toward AA or DA, and the effect of mechanical ventilation on transesophageal PPG can be obviously reduced by filtering techniques.",

"The predictive ability of the CHADS2 index to stratify stroke risk may be mechanistically linked to severity of left atrial (LA) dysfunction. This study investigated the association between the CHADS2 score and LA function. We performed resting transthoracic echocardiography in 970 patients with stable coronary heart disease and normal ejection fraction and calculated baseline LA functional index (LAFI) using a validated formula: (LA emptying fractionÃleft ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral)/LA end-systolic volume indexed to body surface area. We performed regression analyses to evaluate the association between risk scores and LAFI. Among 970 subjects, mean CHADS2 was 1.7Â±1.2. Mean LAFI decreased across tertiles of CHADS2 (42.8Â±18.1, 37.8Â±19.1, 36.7Â±19.4, p<0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, race, systolic blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, myocardial infarction, revascularization, body mass index, smoking, and alcohol use, high CHADS2 remained associated with the lowest quartile of LAFI (odds ratio 2.34, p=0.001). In multivariable analysis of component co-morbidities, heart failure, age, and creatinine clearance<60 ml/min were strongly associated with LA dysfunction. For every point increase in CHADS2, the LAFI decreased by 4.0%. Secondary analyses using CHA2DS2-VASc and R2CHADS2 scores replicated these results. Findings were consistent when excluding patients with baseline atrial fibrillation. In conclusion, CHADS2, CHA2DS2-VASc, and R2CHADS2 scores are associated with LA dysfunction, even in patients without baseline atrial fibrillation. These findings merit further study to determine the role of LA dysfunction in cardioembolic stroke and the value of LAFI for risk stratification.",

"Improvement of prehospital triage is essential to ensure rapid management of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). This study evaluates the feasibility of prehospital quantitative point-of-care cardiac troponin T (POC-cTnT) analysis, its ability to identify patients with AMI, and its capacity to predict mortality. The study was performed in the Central Denmark Region from May 2010 to May 2011. As a supplement to electrocardiography, a prehospital POC-cTnT measurement was performed by a paramedic in patients with suspected AMI. AMI was diagnosed according to the universal definition of myocardial infarction using the ninety-ninth percentile upper reference level as diagnostic cut point. The paramedics performed POC-cTnT measurements in 985 subjects with a symptom duration of 70 minutes (95% CI, 35 to 180); of whom, 200 (20%) had an AMI. The prehospital sample was obtained 88 minutes (range, 58 to 131) before the sample made on admission to the hospital. The sensitivity for detection of patients with an AMI was 39% (95% CI, 32% to 46%) and the diagnostic accuracy of the POC-cTnT values was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.71). Adjusted survival analysis showed a strong significant association between elevated prehospital POC-cTnT level above the detection level of 50 ng/L and mortality in patients with a suspected AMI irrespective of whether an AMI was diagnosed. In conclusion, large-scale quantitative prehospital POC-cTnT testing by paramedics is feasible. An elevated prehospital POC-cTnT value contains diagnostic information and is highly predictive of mortality in patients with a suspected AMI.",

"In addition to parasite resistance, inadequate levels of exposure to antimalarial drugs may contribute to treatment failure. We developed population pharmacokinetic (PK) models to describe the distribution of sulfadoxine (SDX) and pyrimethamine (PYM) in children with uncomplicated malaria in Malawi. The concentration levels of antimalarial drugs in whole blood were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. We found no evidence of underdosing in children as compared with adults; the children had drug exposure levels similar to those described in adults. Treatment failure was more likely in children with lower PYM concentrations on day 14 (P = 0.024), and there was a trend for lower SDX concentrations on day 14 (P = 0.061). SDX and PYM concentrations at levels predictive of treatment failure have been identified at day 14. Less than one-third of the children displayed drug concentration levels above these thresholds after receiving the recommended SDX-pyrimethamine (SP) dose. Our findings suggest that PK factors contributed to the observed high rate of treatment failure, and we therefore recommend a higher SP dose for children under the age of 5 years.",

"Remote LA CFE area was progressively reduced following PVI and linear lesions, and LA ablation reduced right atrial CFE area. Reduction of CFE area at sites remote from ablation would suggest either regression of the advanced atrial substrate or that these CFE were functional phenomena. Nevertheless, in an advanced atrial fibrillation substrate, linear lesions after PVI diminished the target area for CFE ablation, and complete lesions resulted in a favorable clinical outcome.",
"The aim of the study was to determine the accuracy of a rapid diagnostic test (SD Bioline Malaria Ag P.f/ PanÂ®) and fluorescent microscopy (CyScopeÂ®) in confirming presumptive malaria diagnosis in Cotonou. Thick blood smear was used as the reference technique for comparison. Testing was conducted on persons between the ages of 6 months and 70 years at two hospitals from June to October 2010. If malaria was suspected in the sample by the nurse based on clinical findings and sent to laboratory for confirmation, one thick smear, one rapid diagnostic test and one slide for the fluorescent microscopy were performed. All tests were read in hospital laboratories involved with the quality control of thick blood smear in the parasitology laboratory of National University Hospital of Cotonou. A total of 354 patients with clinical diagnosis of malaria were included. Malaria prevalence determined by thick smear, rapid diagnostic test and fluorescent microscopy was 22.8%, 25.4%, and 25.1% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values compared to the thick smears were 96.3, 95.6, 86.7, and 98.9% for rapid diagnostic test; and 97.5, 96.7, 89.8, and 99.27% for fluorescent microscopy. With these performances, these tests meet acceptability standards recommended by WHO for rapid tests (sensitivity > 95%). These two methods have advantages for the confirmation of malaria diagnosis in peripheral health structures that lack the resources to conduct diagnosis confirmation by the thick blood smear.",
"The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between low and frequent low back pain and chronic migraine (CM) and chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) in a large, German population-based sample. Headaches were diagnosed according to International Classification of Headache Disorders-2 criteria and categorized according to frequency (episodic 1-14 days/month or chronic â¤15 days/month) and headache type (migraine or TTH). We defined frequent low back pain as self-reported low back pain on â¥15 days/month. We calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regression analyses, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. There were 5605 respondents who reported headache in the previous year, of whom 255 (4.5%) had Chronic Headache. Migraine was diagnosed in 2933 respondents, of whom 182 (6.2%) had CM. TTH was diagnosed in 1253 respondents, of whom 50 (4.0%) had CTTH. Among 9944 respondents, 6030 reported low back pain, of whom 1267 (21.0%) reported frequent low back pain. In adjusted models, the odds of having frequent low back pain were between 2.1 (95% CI 1.7-2.6) and 2.7 (95% CI 2.3-3.2) times higher in all episodic headache subtypes when compared to No Headache. The odds of having frequent low back pain were between 13.7 (95% CI 7.4-25.3) and 18.3 (95% CI 11.9-28.0) times higher in all chronic headache subtypes when compared to No Headache. Low and frequent low back pain was associated with CM and CTTH. Multiple explanations may contribute to the association of headache and back pain, including the notion that the neurobiology of chronic headache, independent of primary headache type, not only involves the trigeminal pain pathway, but is also a part of abnormal general pain processing.",
"Nuclear receptors modulate macrophage effector functions, which are imperative for clearance or survival of mycobacterial infection. The adopted orphan nuclear receptor Rev-erbÎ± is a constitutive transcriptional repressor as it lacks AF2 domain and was earlier shown to be present in macrophages. In the present study, we highlight the differences in the relative subcellular localization of Rev-erbÎ± in monocytes and macrophages. The nuclear localization of Rev-erbÎ± in macrophages is subsequent to monocyte differentiation. Expression analysis of Rev-erbÎ± elucidated it to be considerably more expressed in M1 phenotype in comparison with M2. Rev-erbÎ± overexpression augments antimycobacterial properties of macrophage by keeping IL10 in a basal repressed state. Further, promoter analysis revealed that IL10 promoter harbors a Rev-erbÎ± binding site exclusive to humans and higher order primates and not mouse, demonstrating a species barrier in its functionality. This direct gene repression is mediated by recruitment of co-repressors NCoR and HDAC3. In addition, our data elucidate that its overexpression reduced the survival of intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis by enhancing phagosome lysosome maturation, an event resulting from IL10 repression. Thus, these findings suggest that Rev-erbÎ± bestows protection against mycobacterial infection by direct gene repression of IL10 and thus provide a novel target in modulating macrophage microbicidal properties.",
"A total of 9016 patients were enrolled and followed for a mean of 4.1 years. The mean reduction in systolic blood pressure was 2.9 mm Hg greater in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group, and the mean reduction in diastolic blood pressure was 1.9 mm Hg greater. The first coprimary outcome occurred at a rate of 5.4% per 100 person-years in both groups (hazard ratio with irbesartan, 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.08; P=0.85). The second coprimary outcome occurred at a rate of 7.3% per 100 person-years among patients receiving irbesartan and 7.7% per 100 person-years among patients receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.02; P=0.12). The rates of first hospitalization for heart failure (a prespecified secondary outcome) were 2.7% per 100 person-years among patients receiving irbesartan and 3.2% per 100 person-years among patients receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.98). Among patients who were in sinus rhythm at baseline, there was no benefit of irbesartan in preventing hospitalization for atrial fibrillation or atrial fibrillation recorded on 12-lead electrocardiography, nor was there a benefit in a subgroup that underwent transtelephonic monitoring. More patients in the irbesartan group than in the placebo group had symptomatic hypotension (127 vs. 64) and renal dysfunction (43 vs. 24).",

"Randomized trials showed that mTOR inhibitors prevent early development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). However, the action of these drugs on CAV late after transplant is controversial, and their effectiveness for CAV prevention in clinical practice is poorly explored. In this observational study we included 143 consecutive heart transplant recipients who underwent serial intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), receiving either everolimus or mycophenolate as adjunctive therapy to cyclosporine. Ninety-one recipients comprised the early cohort, receiving IVUS at weeks 3-6 and year 1 after transplant, and 52 the late cohort, receiving IVUS at years 1 and 5 after transplant. Everolimus independently reduced the odds for early CAV (0.14 [0.01-0.77]; p = 0.02) but it did not appear to influence late CAV progression. High-dose statins were found to be associated with reduced CAV progression both early and late after transplant (p â¤ 0.05). Metabolic abnormalities, such as high triglycerides, were associated with late, but not with early CAV progression. By highlighting a differential effect of everolimus and metabolic abnormalities on early and late changes of graft coronary morphology, this observational study supports the hypothesis that everolimus may be effective for CAV prevention but not for CAV treatment, and that risk factors intervene in a time-dependent sequence during CAV development.",

The efficacy was assessed by the sum of pain intensity differences, the curve of mean pain intensity, the number of pain free at 2 h, and the total pain relief. Tolerability was assessed by recording adverse events within 4 h after drug assumption and evaluating the global judgement of patients. The comparison of these parameters did not show differences between the two drugs which resulted absolutely overlapping in pain relief and patients evaluation. In conclusion, we confirm the efficacy and safety of PCF such as SUM in the treatment of migraine attacks.",

"A fixed-dose pediatric formulation of artesunate and mefloquine (Artequin Pediatric) has been developed. In this open, non-comparative study in Cameroonian children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, the safety and efficacy of this formulation was tested, with a particular emphasis on the risk of neuropsychiatric adverse events (AEs). In total, 220 subjects, weighing between 10 and 20 kg, were enrolled; 213 qualified for analysis. Artesunate-mefloquine was given once daily for 3 days. Overall, 13.1% of patients reported mild to moderate neuropsychiatric AEs (elicited through a structured questionnaire or reported spontaneously) out of which 3.8% (mainly insomnia) were considered drug-related. Other drug-related AEs were infrequent (< 3%). Polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rate (adequate clinical and parasitological response) determined by survival analysis at 28 and 63 days was 96.6%. New infections were observed in 11.2% of evaluable patients at 63 days. The new formulation was well tolerated and efficacious in the population investigated.",
"Parietal pleurectomy is the most effective method of preventing a recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax. Until recently, however, it has required thoracotomy which is associated with significant morbidity. The advent of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has offered a less traumatizing method of performing parietal pleurectomy, but experience in this operation is limited. In this study we compared the operative results of our first twelve patients treated using VATS (VATS-group) with twelve consecutive patients operated on via thoracotomy (T-group) before we started using VATS. The groups were comparable in terms of age, sex ratio and the length of preoperative pleural drainage. In the VATS-group peroperative blood loss was markedly less, but the mean operative time was 16 min longer than in the T-group. There was practically no difference in the number of opioid dosages given postoperatively between the groups, but the hospital stay was approximately three days shorter in the VATS-group than in the T-group. Inability to work lasted two weeks longer in the T-group than in the VATS-group. In the T-group there were no recurrences of pneumothorax, but in the VATS-group pneumothorax recurred in two patients. They were both treated using a Roeder loop to excise bullae. One patient was reoperated via thoracotomy and another was treated by pleural suction. The initial Finnish experience of VATS-pleurectomy shows that parietal pleurectomy can be performed safely with less morbidity in the treatment of recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. However, recurrences in the VATS-group underlines the proper selection of technical methods when using this method of treatment.",

"The prevalence and prognostic value of a concomitant diagnosis of symptomatic or asymptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), as defined by the current International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, in patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis (AL), are unknown. We studied 46 consecutive patients with AL who underwent quantification of serum M-protein and clonal bone marrow plasma cells, as well as a comprehensive evaluation for end organ damage by MM. Using standard morphology and CD138 immunohistochemical staining, 57% and 80% of patients were found to have concomitant MM, respectively. Nine patients exhibited end organ damage consistent with a diagnosis of symptomatic MM. While overall survival was similar between AL patients with or without concurrent myeloma (1-year overall survival 68% vs. 87%; P = 0.27), a diagnosis of symptomatic myeloma was associated with inferior outcome (1-year overall survival 39% vs. 81%; P = 0.005). Quantification of bone marrow plasma cells by both standard morphology and CD138 immunohistochemistry identified a much higher prevalence of concurrent MM in patients with AL than previously reported. Evaluation of bone marrow plasma cell infiltration and presence of myeloma associated end organ damage could be clinically useful for prognostication of patients with AL.",
"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been shown to improve survival and symptoms in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, congestive heart failure, and prolonged QRS duration. LV lead placement is achieved by placing the lead in the coronary sinus, an endovascular approach, or by a minimally invasive robotic-assisted thoracoscopic epicardial approach. There are no data directly comparing the 2 methods. Patients eligible for CRT were randomized to the endovascular and epicardial arms. Coronary sinus lead placement was achieved using the standard technique, and epicardial leads were placed using a minimally invasive robotic-assisted thoracoscopic approach. The primary end point was a decrease in LV end-systolic volume index at 6 months. The secondary end points included 30-day mortality rate, measures of clinical improvement, 1-year electrical lead performance, and 1-year survival rate. The relative improvement of LV end-systolic volume index from baseline to 6 months was similar between the arms (28.8% for the transvenous [n = 12] vs 30.5% for the epicardial (n = 9) arm, p = 0.93). There were no significant differences in the secondary end points between the 2 groups. In conclusion, there were no differences in echocardiographic and clinical outcomes comparing a conventional endovascular approach versus robotic-assisted surgical epicardial LV lead placement for CRT in patients with heart failure. Surgical approaches are still a viable alternative when a transvenous procedure has failed or is not technically feasible.",

"Intracellular polymerization and sickling depend markedly on the cellular concentration of sickle hemoglobin (Hb S). A possible therapeutic strategy for sickle cell disease is based on reducing the cellular concentration of Hb S through prevention of erythrocyte dehydration. The K-Cl cotransporter is a major determinant of sickle cell dehydration and is inhibited by increasing erythrocyte Mg content. We studied 10 patients with sickle cell disease before treatment and after 2 and 4 wk of treatment with oral Mg supplements (0.6 meq/kg/d Mg pidolate). Hematological parameters, erythrocyte Na, K, and Mg content, erythrocyte density, membrane transport of Na and K, and osmotic gradient ektacytometry were measured. We found significant increases in sickle erythrocyte Mg and K content and reduction in the number of dense sickle erythrocytes. Erythrocyte K-Cl cotransport was reduced significantly. We also observed a significant reduction in the absolute reticulocyte count and in the number of immature reticulocytes. Ektacytometric analysis showed changes indicative of improved hydration of the erythrocytes. There were no laboratory or clinical signs of hypermagnesemia. Mild, transient diarrhea was the only reported side effect. We conclude that oral Mg supplementation reduces the number of dense erythrocytes and improves the erythrocyte membrane transport abnormalities of patients with sickle cell disease.",

"Although left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy has been proposed as a factor predisposing to atrial fibrillation (AF), its relevance to prognosis and selection of therapeutic strategies is unclear. We identified 2,105 patients with echocardiographic data on LV mass enrolled in the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial. LV hypertrophy was defined as increased LV mass, stratified by American Society of Echocardiography criteria. The primary end point was all-cause mortality, secondary end point was as per AFFIRM trial definition, and tertiary end point was cardiovascular hospitalizations. We compared "strict" versus "lenient" rate control in patients with increased LV mass, and studied association of heart failure (HF) with preserved and decreased systolic function in patients with increased LV mass. Over 6 years, 332 deaths (15.7%) were reported. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of severely increased LV mass for all-cause mortality was 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.79, p=0.045) for the overall population and 1.61 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.37, p=0.016) for the rhythm-control arm. Increased LV mass was a predictor of cardiovascular hospitalizations in the lenient rate-control group (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.82, p=0.03) but not in the strict rate-control group. Severely increased LV mass was predictive of cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with HF with preserved (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.2, p=0.03) and decreased LV systolic function (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 5.2, p=0.02). Thus, LV hypertrophy is a significant independent predictor of mortality in patients with AF, especially those managed with rhythm control. In patients with LV hypertrophy, strict rate control may be associated with better outcomes than lenient rate control. LV hypertrophy portends higher cardiovascular morbidity in patients with AF and HF.",
"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in developing countries including Nepal. One of the common presentations of TB is pleural effusion. The diagnosis of tubercular pleural effusion can be difficult because of the low rate of detecting tubercule bacilli by direct stain and culture of pleural fluid for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Pleural biopsy can be useful but is invasive and requires experts. In this context, pleural fluid Adenosine Deaminase (ADA) level has been proposed as easy, cheap and highly sensitive test for diagnosis of TB pleural effusion. The present study was undertaken to define the role ofpleural fluid ADA value in accurate diagnosis of TB pleural effusion. A Prospective analysis of 100 patients admitted in Nepal Medical College and teaching Hospital with pleural effusion was done. Pleural fluid ADA level was evaluated in all patients, and significance of pleural fluid ADA level in TB pleural effusion was studied. It was found that mean ADA level in pleural fluid was 105.8 +/- 67.23 U/L in cases of TB, as compared to 16.83 +/- 8.91 U/L in malignancy, 44.53 +/- 32.84 U/L in parapneumonic effusion and 15.94 +/- 4.88 U/L in patients with miscellaneous diagnosis. For a cut-off value of 42.19 U/L for diagnosis of TB pleural effusion, sensitivity was found to be 90.8% and specificity 82.8%. Almost all patients diagnosed to have TB pleural effusion responded completely to anti-tubercular treatment. So, we concluded that pleural fluid ADA analysis could be easy, cheap and highly sensitive and specific test for diagnosis of TB pleural effusion.",
"The thoracic vent is a new minimally invasive device for the treatment of spontaneous and iatrogenic pneumothorax. It consists of a polyurethane catheter connected to a plastic chamber containing a one-way valve. As there is no need to connect the thoracic vent to an underwater seal device, immobilization and hospitalization can be avoided. So far the performance of the thoracic vent has been evaluated only in patients without pleural effusions and without signs of tension pneumothorax. Hence, we have performed a randomized study comparing the treatment of pneumothorax by means of the thoracic vent versus conventional intercostal tube drainage in 30 patients, including some with tension pneumothorax. 17 patients were treated with the thoracic vent, 13 with conventional intercostal tube drainage. We found no significant differences in the rate of reexpansion and rate of complications between the group treated with the thoracic vent and the group treated with intercostal tube drainage, but the patients treated with the thoracic vent needed significantly less analgesics. 70% of the patients treated with the thoracic vent were successfully managed on an outpatient basis. All patients treated with intercostal tube drainage were hospitalised; duration of inpatient-therapy was 8 +/- 6.2 days (mean +/- SD).",
"The rate of the primary efficacy end point, a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, urgent revascularization, or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor rescue therapy (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa bailout) through day 7, did not differ significantly between the two groups (hazard ratio with pretreatment, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.25; P=0.81). The rate of the key safety end point of all Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding episodes, whether related or not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting (CABG), through day 7 was increased with pretreatment (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.19 to 3.02; P=0.006). The rates of TIMI major bleeding and life-threatening bleeding not related to CABG were increased by a factor of 3 and 6, respectively. Pretreatment did not reduce the rate of the primary outcome among patients undergoing PCI (69% of the patients) but increased the rate of TIMI major bleeding at 7 days. All the results were confirmed at 30 days and in prespecified subgroups.",

One hundred two patients were included and analyzed. Fifty patients were treated with the pigtail tube and 52 patients were treated with the traditional chest tube. The extubation time, mean hospital stay, evacuation rate, and total cost were similar without a significant statistical difference. Among the chest tube group, 15 underwent surgical intervention as a result of delayed resolution and hemopneumothorax; and among the pigtail group, 15 had other procedures for pneumothorax, including chest tube insertion and surgical intervention. This verifies our initial suspicion that the effectiveness of the pigtail drainage system is no less than that of the chest tube. Therefore, when considering ambulatory ability and good patient compliance, the pigtail tube drainage system can be considered as the treatment of choice for spontaneous pneumothorax.",
"A short course of high-dose methylprednisolone decreased the duration of severe pain in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease, but patients who received methylprednisolone had more rebound attacks after therapy was discontinued.

"Plasmodium vivax infection in humans can relapse and is associated with iron deficiency. The immune response plays an important role in preventing relapse. In this study we analyzed the effect of zinc and vitamin C supplementation on hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and immune response in patients with P. vivax malaria. We measured immune response by examining interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels. Subjects were divided into either treatment or control groups. The treatment group received daily zinc and vitamin C supplementation for 45 days. Compliance with supplement consumption was recorded weekly. After 45 days of supplementation, IFN-gamma and IL-1 levels were remeasured. All study subjects in both groups had normal hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. The hemoglobin levels increased only in the supplementation group (p=0.011), while hematocrit levels increased in both the supplementation (p=0.001) and control (p=0.023) groups. IFN-gamma decreased slightly in the supplementation group, but the change was not significant (p=0.688). IL-10 increased slightly in both the supplementation and the control groups, but the change were not significant (p=0.421 and p=0.556, respectively), suggesting the elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were unrelated to immune response.",

"Traditional acupuncture (TA) and ear acupuncture (EA) are used for treatment of headache, trigeminal neuralgia, and retro-auricular pain. The purpose of this study is to develop effective treatment using combined acupuncture (CA) which consists of TA and EA and to set clinical protocols for future trials. Participants were divided into TA (n = 15) control and CA (n = 34) experimental groups. Obligatory points among Korean Five Element Acupuncture and optional individual points along with symptom points were used in the TA group. The CA group was exposed to ear points of Fossion and TA. Acupuncture treatment consisted of six mandatory sessions per patient over 3 weeks and extended to 12 sessions. Pain was assessed using the visual analogue scale. We compared TA to CA and researched their relevant publications. No significant difference was observed between the two groups (p = 0.968) which showed pain-alleviating tendency. Pain alleviation was significantly different after the fifth and sixth sessions (p = 0.021, p = 0.025), with headache being the most significantly relieved (F = 4.399, p = 0.018) among the diseases. When assessing pain intensity, both the Headache Impact Test and the Migraine Disability Assessment Scale should be adopted for headache and the fractal electroencephalography method be used in pain diseases. In the future, studies should consist of TA, EA, and CA groups; each group having 20 patients. Treatment number should to be no less than 10 sessions. Korean Five Element Acupuncture should be a compulsory inclusion along with individual points being optional inclusion in TA. EA could be selected from Nogier, Fossion and so forth. In conclusion, acupuncture treatment, whether TA or CA, showed pain alleviation in headache, trigeminal neuralgia, and retro-auricular pain, but no significant difference was seen between groups. Prospective, well-controlled, and relevant protocols using multimodal strategies to define the role of TA, EA, and CA are needed.",

"Hydroxyurea (HU) can increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in sickle cell anemia (HbSS). To identify determinants of the HbF response, we studied 150 HU-treated patients grouped by quartiles of change in HbF from baseline to 2 years. Half of the HU-assigned patients had long-term increments in HbF. In the top two quartiles, HbF increased to 18.1% and 8.8%. These patients had the highest baseline neutrophil and reticulocyte counts, and largest treatment-associated decrements in these counts. In the lower two quartiles, 2-year HbF levels (4.2% and 3.9%) and blood counts changed little from baseline. In the highest HbF response quartile, myelosuppression developed in less than 6 months, compliance was best, and final doses of HU were 15 to 22.5 mg/kg. All four quartiles had substantial increases of F cells in the first year. This was maintained for 2 years only in the top three quartiles. Leukocyte and reticulocyte counts decreased initially in all quartiles, but drifted back toward baseline levels in the lowest HbF response quartile. Initial HbF level and phenotype of the F-cell production (FCP) locus were not associated with HbF response, but absence of a Central African Republic (CAR) haplotype was. Bone marrow ability to withstand HU treatment may be important for sustained HbF increases during HU treatment of HbSS.",

"Phase III clinical study was performed to evaluate clinical utility of 123I-MIBG in the localization of tumors in 48 patients with tumors of sympathetic and adrenomedullary origin, diagnosed or strongly suspected. Sixteen patients had pheochromocytoma, 23 had neuroblastoma, 7 had medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, and 2 had Sipple syndrome. In 3 out of 48 patients, 123I-MIBG scintigraphy was performed twice. The clinical utility of 123I-MIBG was evaluated in 50 cases. Out of 140 lesions, 123I-MIBG scintigraphy demonstrated 51 true positive, 79 true negative, 1 false positive, and 2 false negative. Seven lesions were not evaluable. Sensitivity was 96.2%, Specificity was 98.8%, and Accuracy was 97.7%. An acquisition between 4 hrs and a day after injection was adequate for tumor detection. Neither adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory findings were noted in relation to 123I-MIBG injections. Our study indicates that 123I-MIBG is a safe and useful radiotracer for visualization and localization of tumors of sympathetic and adrenomedullary origin.",

"An excessive blood pressure (BP) reduction might be dangerous in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. In the Studio Italiano Sugli Effetti CARDIOvascolari del Controllo della Pressione Arteriosa SIStolica (Cardio-Sis), 1111 nondiabetic patients with systolic BP â¥150 mm Hg were randomly assigned to a systolic BP target <140 mm Hg (standard control) or <130 mm Hg (tight control). We stratified patients by absence (n=895) or presence (n=216) of established cardiovascular disease at entry. Antihypertensive treatment was open-label and tailored to each patient's needs. After 2-year follow-up, the primary end point of the study, electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy, occurred less frequently in the tight than in the standard control group in the patients without (10.8% versus 15.2%) and with (14.1% versus 23.5%) established cardiovascular disease (P for interaction=0.82). The main secondary end point, a composite of cardiovascular events and all-cause death, occurred less frequently in the tight than in the standard control group both in patients without (1.47 versus 3.68 patient-years; P=0.016) and with (7.87 versus 11.22 patient-years; P=0.049) previous cardiovascular disease. In a multivariable Cox model, allocation to tight BP control reduced the risk of cardiovascular events to a similar extent in patients with or without overt cardiovascular disease at randomization (P for interaction=0.43). In conclusion, an intensive treatment aimed to lower systolic BP<130 mm Hg reduced left ventricular hypertrophy and improved clinical outcomes to a similar extent in patients with hypertension and without established cardiovascular disease.",
"Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is effective for the treatment of patients with heart failure and a wide QRS duration, particularly left bundle branch block. However, subjects with right bundle branch block (RBBB) do not appear to benefit from CRT. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with specific RBBB conduction patterns responded to CRT in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial with Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT) trial. In the present post hoc analysis, patients with RBBB who received CRT with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (n = 132) were divided into 2 groups according to the baseline QRS morphology in the inferior and high lateral leads: group 1: left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) pattern (n = 80; 60.6%); and group 2: non-LAFB pattern (n = 52; 39.4%). Subjects with RBBB who received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator served as the control group (n = 87). The primary end point was echocardiographic response to CRT, defined as percent change in left ventricular (LV) and left atrial volumes from baseline to 1 year. The secondary end point was heart failure or death. The non-LAFB group demonstrated a significantly larger percent reduction in LV end-diastolic volume, LV end-systolic volume, and left atrial volume compared to controls (-11%, p <0.0001; -17%, p <0.0001; -15%, p <0.0001, respectively) and LAFB (-5%, p = 0.028; -7%, p = 0.019; -6%; p = 0.022; respectively) by multivariate analysis. No difference was found in the 3-year crude event rates for death or heart failure among the LAFB (22%), non-LAFB (21%), or ICD-only (20%) groups (p = NS). In conclusion, conduction patterns influence echocardiographic response to CRT in patients with RBBB, with favorable reductions in the LV and left atrial volumes in those without an LAFB conduction pattern. This echocardiographic benefit did not translate into a reduction in heart failure or death during a 3-year follow-up period.",

"A new fixed-dose artesunate (AS)-mefloquine (MQ) was assessed in adults hospitalized for 28 days with uncomplicated drug-resistant falciparum malaria. The patients (n = 25/arm) were treated with (i) two fixed-dose tablets (AS-MQ arm; 100 mg AS-200 mg MQ/tablet) daily for 3 days (days 0, 1, and 2) or (ii) nonfixed AS (AS-plus-MQ arm; 4 mg/kg of body weight/day for 3 days) plus MQ (15 mg/kg on day 1 and 10 mg/kg on day 2), dosed by weight. Clinical laboratory electrocardiogram (ECG), adverse events (AEs), efficacy, and pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed over 28 days. Both regimens were well tolerated. No AEs were drug related. Two serious AEs of malaria-induced hypotension occurring in the AS-MQ arm necessitated rescue treatment. There were no significant changes in hematology, biochemistry, or PR and QRS intervals. For all patients, mean Fridericia-corrected QT intervals were significantly (P < or = 0.0027) prolonged on day 3 (407 ms) and day 7 (399 ms) versus day 0 (389 ms), in parallel with significant (P < or = 0.0003) falls in heart rates (67 [day 3], 73 [day 7], and 83 [day 0] beats/minute). Fixed-nonfixed formulations were bioequivalent for MQ, but not for AS and dihydroartemisinin (DHA). One AS-MQ patient developed a new infection on day 28; his day 28 plasma MQ concentration was 503.8 ng/ml. Fixed-dose AS-MQ was well tolerated, had pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles broadly similar to those of nonfixed AS plus MQ, and is a suitable replacement.",
"Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) are highly efficacious antimalarial therapies in Africa.

Overall, DP was associated with a higher risk of early vomiting than AL (15.1% versus 7.1%; P = 0.007). The increased risk of early vomiting with DP was only present among breastfeeding children (relative risk [RR] = 3.35, P = 0.001) compared with children who were not breastfeeding (RR = 1.03, P = 0.94). Age less than 18 months was a risk factor for early vomiting independent of treatment (RR = 3.27, P = 0.02). Our findings indicate that AL may be better tolerated than DP among young breastfeeding children treated for uncomplicated malaria.",

"3D environment and high cell density play an important role in restoring and supporting the phenotypes of cells represented in cardiac tissues. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the suitability of high density sphere (HDS) cultures for studies of cardiomyocyte-, endothelial-, and stem-cell biology. Primary adult cardiac cells from nine human biopsies were cultured using different media for up to 9 weeks. The possibilities to favor a certain cell phenotype and induce production of extra cellular matrix (ECM) were studied by histology, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative real-time PCR. Defined media gave significant increase in both cardiac- and progenitor-specific markers and also an intraluminal position of endothelial cells over time. Cardiac media showed indication of differentiation and maturity of HDS considering the ECM production and activities within NOTCH regulation but no additional cardiac differentiation. Endothelial media gave no positive effects on endothelial phenotype but increased proliferation without fibroblast overgrowth. In addition, indications for early vasculogenesis were found. It was also possible to affect the Wnt signaling in HDS by addition of a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitor. In conclusion, these findings show the suitability of HDS as in vitro model for studies of cardiomyocyte-, endothelial-, and stem-cell biology.",

"We assess the level of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in tear fluids and other serum parameters associated with diabetes in different degrees of diabetic retinopathy. We have performed a prospective, nonrandomized, observational study. Study population consisted of 16 healthy subjects (controls) and 32 type 2 diabetic patients: 16 affected by proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and 16 with nonproliferative retinopathy (NDPR, background/preproliferative). Body mass index, urinary albumin, blood glucose, HbA1c, and tear levels of TNF-alpha were measured in all subjects. The value of glycaemia, microalbuminurea, and Body mass index in diabetic retinopathy groups were higher than those in control group (P < 0.05). Glycemia in NPDR: 6.6âmmol/L (range: 5.8-6.3); in PDR: 6.7âmmol/L (range: 6.1-7.2); in control: 5.7âmmol/L (range: 4.9-6.1); microalbuminurea in NPDR: 10.6âmg/L (range: 5.6-20); in PDR: 25.2âmg/L (range: 17-40); in control: 5.3âmg/L (range: 2.6-10); Body mass index in NPDR: 26âKg/m(2) (range: 20.3-40); in PDR: 28âKg/m(2) (range 20.3-52); in control: 21âKg/m(2) (range 19-26). The TNF-alpha concentrations in tears increase with the severity of pathology and were lower in control group than in diabetic subjects. In the end, the level of TNF-alpha is highly correlated with severity of diabetic retinopathy and with nephropathy. Tear fluid collection may be a useful noninvasive method for the detection of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.",
"We investigated the role of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs (SAs) in adrenal imaging. We evaluated 15 patients (6 men and 9 women, mean age 47 +/- 17 years) with imaging-detected adrenal tumors. Patient population was divided into two groups on the basis of the nature of adrenal lesions. Group 1 consisted of patients with benign adrenal lesions (n = 10). Group 2 consisted of patients with malignant adrenal lesions (n = 5). Pathology examinations were obtained in 13 cases: 7 pheochromocytomas, 2 adenomas, 2 cysts, 1 carcinoma, and 1 fibro-histiocytoma. One patient had a proven diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer associated with the presence of a right adrenal mass. The last patient had a clinical diagnosis of Werner syndrome associated with the presence of a large left adrenal mass. All patients underwent scientigraphic studies using radiolabeled SAs, of which indium-111 (In-111) pentetreotide was used in 11 cases and technetium-99m (Tc-99m)-labeled peptides (P-587 or P-829) were used in the remaining four cases. No significant labeled SAs uptake was observed in the majority (8 of 10, 80%) of the benign adrenal lesions (Group 1); however, increased uptake was found in two benign pheochromocytomas. Conversely, significant labeled SAs uptake was observed in the majority (4 of 5, 80%) of the malignant adrenal lesions (Group 2); however, the last lesion (carcinoma) did not show abnormal uptake. Results of this study show that the majority of benign adrenal tumors do not concentrate radiolabeled SAs; conversely, the majority of malignant adrenal lesions show significant SAs uptake, suggesting the presence of somatostatin receptors. This finding may allow the use of somatostatin as a treatment agent in malignant adrenal tumors. Thus, the main role of labeled SAs in adrenal imaging consists of lesion characterization rather than tumor detection and localization.",

"Utilization, efficacy, perception, and acceptability of rectal artesunates for treatment of malaria were assessed in 264 children below 5 years attending two tertiary health facilities in Abeokuta, Nigeria. The children systematically selected were 136 from State Hospital Ijaye and 128 from Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Idi-Aba. Body weights and vital statistics of the children were measured; and blood samples were collected before and 24âh after administration of the rectal artesunates (Plasmotrim-50/200âmg Artesunate) to evaluate the efficacy of the suppository. The first dose of rectal artesunate suppository was administered at a dose of 5-10âmg/kg of body weight per rectum. Giemsa thin and thick films were employed to determine parasite species, malaria parasite count/Î¼L (MPC/Î¼L), and percentage of parasitized red blood cells (PPRBCs). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0. Plasmodium falciparum was the malaria parasite identified by blood examination, with a pretreatment prevalence of 98.9%. Male children had higher infection rate (55%) than females (45%), and infection among age groups and weight groups varied. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant difference between weight and malaria parasite count (p<0.05). Post-treatment analysis after 24âh showed that prevalence dropped by 73%, with females having higher crash rate (77%) than males (69%) but with no statistical difference (p>0.05) among the sexes. Chi-square analysis of pre- and post-treatment revealed a significant difference between MPC/Î¼L and PPRBC at p<0.05. This confirmed the efficacy of rectal artesunate in reducing the parasite density (parasitaemia) within 24âh of treatment. On acceptability, 99.60% of parents accepted to use the suppository. However, 87.1% of parents preferred its usage, as it is easy to administer with no adverse effects when administered on their children. If health officials increase more public knowledge on the use of rectal artesunates, the high mortality now experienced in children under 5 years due to malaria disease would be greatly reduced.",

"A sizeable proportion of migraineurs in need of preventive therapy do not significantly benefit from monotherapy. The objective of the study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial testing whether combination therapy of topiramate and nortriptyline is useful in patients who had less than 50% decrease in headache frequency with the use of the single agents. Patients with episodic migraine were enrolled if they had less than 50% reduction in headache frequency after 8Â weeks of using topiramate (TPM) (100Â mg/day) or nortriptyline (NTP) (30Â mg/day). They were randomized (blinded fashion) to have placebo added to their regimen, or to receive the second medication (combination therapy). Primary endpoint was decrease in number of headache days at 6Â weeks, relative to baseline, comparing both groups. Secondary endpoint was proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in headache frequency at 6Â weeks relative to baseline. A total of 38 patients were randomized to receive combination therapy, while 30 continued on monotherapy (with placebo) (six drop outs in the combination group and three for each single drug group). For the primary endpoint, mean and standard deviation (SD) of reduction in headache frequency were 4.6 (1.9) for those in polytherapy, relative to 3.5 (2.3) for those in monotherapy. Differences were significant (pÂ <Â 0.05]. Similarly, 78.3% of patients randomized to receive polytherapy had at least 50% headache reduction, as compared to 37% in monotherapy (pÂ <Â 0.04). Finally we conclude that combination therapy (of TPM and NTP) is effective in patients with incomplete benefit using these agents in monotherapy.",
"The 2-year follow-up results for a randomized placebo-controlled study of 47 patients with multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis treated with either the new diarylquinoline TMC207, recently renamed bedaquiline, or placebo, added to the first 8 weeks of a background regimen, are presented. Bedaquiline significantly reduced the time to culture conversion over 24 weeks (hazard ratio, 2.253; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 4.71; P = 0.031). With the exception of nausea reported in 26% of patients receiving bedaquiline and none receiving placebo, adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in both groups of patients: bilateral hearing impairment, extremity pain, acne, and noncardiac chest pain occurred in 13 and 21%, 17 and 13%, 9 and 17%, and 4 and 17% of patients, respectively, receiving bedaquiline or placebo. Excluding resistance to ethambutol and ethionamide, only one patient receiving bedaquiline acquired resistance to companion drugs, but five patients receiving placebo (4.8% versus 21.7%; P = 0.18) acquired resistance to companion drugs, and resistance to ofloxacin was acquired in four patients receiving placebo and none receiving bedaquiline (0% versus 22%; 0 = 0.066). In all, 23 patients (49%), including 13 receiving placebo (54%) and 10 receiving bedaquiline (44%), discontinued the study prior to its completion, 12 during the first 24 weeks of treatment. Eight subjects were withdrawn for noncompliance or default, and seven withdrew consent, citing the rigorous program of investigations for safety and pharmacokinetic monitoring. Bedaquiline may contribute to the management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis by effecting more rapid sputum culture negativity and by preventing acquired resistance to companion drugs.",

"Before enrollment, 40% of the patients had used a vitamin K antagonist. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study because of a clear benefit in favor of apixaban. There were 51 primary outcome events (1.6% per year) among patients assigned to apixaban and 113 (3.7% per year) among those assigned to aspirin (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32 to 0.62; P<0.001). The rates of death were 3.5% per year in the apixaban group and 4.4% per year in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.02; P=0.07). There were 44 cases of major bleeding (1.4% per year) in the apixaban group and 39 (1.2% per year) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.75; P=0.57); there were 11 cases of intracranial bleeding with apixaban and 13 with aspirin. The risk of a first hospitalization for cardiovascular causes was reduced with apixaban as compared with aspirin (12.6% per year vs. 15.9% per year, P<0.001). The treatment effects were consistent among important subgroups.",
"The efficacy of the vasoactive compound buflomedil on previously described microcirculation abnormalities observed in sickle cell disease (SCD) was investigated using bulbar conjunctival angioscopy (BCA) and laser doppler flux metering. Eleven sickle cell disease patients at steady state were studied in a double-blind randomized parallel-versus-placebo study (5 patients were given placebo and 6 patients received 600 mg buflomedil per day for 21 days after a washout period of 15 days). The blood flux score measured by BCA improved, indicating reduced entrapment of sickle red blood cells. There was a striking improvement of reactive alterations of vasomotion in the buflomedil group, particularly in postocclusive reactive hyperemia; the half return time was also significantly reduced. These results encourage further studies with buflomedil to investigate long-term effects of this compound in SCD, potential prevention of acute vaso-occlusive events, and degenerative complications.",

"Pistachios are high in lutein, beta-carotene, and gamma-tocopherol relative to other nuts; however, studies of the effects of pistachios on oxidative status are lacking. We conducted a randomized, crossover controlled-feeding study to evaluate 2 doses of pistachios on serum antioxidants and biomarkers of oxidative status in 28 hypercholesterolemic adults (LDL-cholesterol >or=2.86 mmol/L). Participants consumed 3 isoenergetic diets for 4 wk each after a 2-wk baseline Western diet. Experimental diets included a lower-fat control diet without pistachios (25% total fat) with 1 serving/d (i.e. 32-63 g/d; energy adjusted) of pistachios (1 PD; 10% energy from pistachios; 30% total fat) or with 2 servings/d (63-126 g/d; energy adjusted) of pistachios (2 PD; 20% energy from pistachios; 34% total fat). When participants consumed the pistachio-enriched diets, they had higher plasma lutein (P < 0.0001), alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene (P < 0.01) concentrations than after the baseline diet. After consuming the pistachio diets, participants had greater plasma lutein (P < 0.001) and gamma-tocopherol (P < 0.05; 2 PD only) relative to the lower-fat control diet. After the 2 PD diet period, participants also had lower serum oxidized-LDL concentrations than following the baseline diet period (P < 0.05). After both the 1 PD and 2 PD diet periods, they had lower serum oxidized-LDL concentrations than after the control diet period (P < 0.05). The change in oxidized-LDL from baseline correlated positively with the change in LDL-cholesterol across all treatments (r = 0.42; P < 0.005). After controlling for the change in serum LDL-cholesterol as a covariate, increases in serum lutein and gamma-tocopherol following the 2 PD period were still modestly associated with decreases in oxidized-LDL (r = -0.36, P = 0.06 and r = -0.35, P = 0.08, respectively). This suggests that a heart-healthy diet including pistachios contributes to the decrease in the serum oxidized-LDL concentration through cholesterol-lowering and may provide an added benefit as a result of the antioxidants the pistachios contain.",

"The safety of artemether-lumefantrine in patients with acute, uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria was investigated prospectively using the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and pure-tone thresholds. Secondary outcomes included polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:1:1 ratio to either artemether-lumefantrine (N = 159), atovaquone-proguanil (N = 53), or artesunate-mefloquine (N = 53). The null hypothesis (primary outcome), claiming that the percentage of patients with a baseline to Day-7 ABR Wave III latency increase of > 0.30 msec is â¥ 15% after administration of artemether-lumefantrine, was rejected; 2.6% of patients (95% confidence interval: 0.7-6.6) exceeded 0.30 msec, i.e., significantly below 15% (P < 0.0001). A model-based analysis found no apparent relationship between drug exposure and ABR change. In all three groups, average improvements (2-4 dB) in pure-tone thresholds were observed, and polymerase chain reaction-corrected cure rates were > 95% to Day 42. The results support the continued safe and efficacious use of artemether-lumefantrine in uncomplicated falciparum malaria.",
"High residual platelet reactivity (RPR) on clopidogrel treatment has been associated with increased risk for ischemic events during follow-up in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence, predictors, and clinical consequences of high RPR in a large population of patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting. Overall, 833 patients received point-of-care testing of platelet inhibition 30 days after percutaneous coronary intervention. High RPR was diagnosed on the basis of P2Yââ reaction units >230. The incidence and predictors of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and serious bleeding events were assessed up to 1 year from the day of testing. P2Yââ reaction units were normally distributed, and 264 patients were classified as poor responders (31.7%). Independent predictors of response to clopidogrel were male gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.51), age (OR 0.96), diabetes mellitus (OR 0.51), and use of proton pump inhibitors (OR 0.59). At 1 year, poor responders showed higher rates of death (4.6% vs 1.9%, p = 0.032) and serious bleeding events (4.9% vs 1.8%, p = 0.009) compared with good responders. After adjustment for confounders, high RPR did not emerge as an independent predictor of mortality (OR 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23 to 1.42, p = 0.23) or serious bleeding events (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.52, p = 0.29). The results did not change using the a cut-off value for P2Yââ reaction units of 208. In conclusion, 1/3 of patients with acute coronary syndromes who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting showed high on-treatment RPR on bedside monitoring. They had a worse prognosis, but the level of platelet inhibition was not independently associated with the incidence of ischemic or bleeding events.",

"Subjects with symptomatic, persistent/high-burden paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) were enrolled at 6 centers (n=86) and randomized to 1 of 2 arms. For group I, all CFAE regions with an interval confidence level >7 were ablated followed by pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). For group II, only CFAE sites with continuous electric activity were ablated followed by PVI. For PVI, all 4 PV antra were isolated with confirmed entrance block. Subjects were followed for 1 year with a visit, ECG, and 48-hour Holter every 3 months. Symptoms were confirmed by loop recording. The primary end point was freedom from arrhythmia >30 seconds at 1 year. For both group I and II, CFAE ablation prolonged AF cycle length (25Â±33 versus 23Â±33 ms; P=0.78) and resulted in similar rates of AF termination (37% versus 28%; P=0.42). Radiofrequency duration during CFAE ablation was significantly less in group II (23Â±20 versus 38Â±20 minutes; P=0.002). At 1-year follow-up, freedom from AF/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia recurrence was significantly higher in group I versus group II after 1 procedure (50% versus 28%; P=0.03). There were also significantly fewer repeat procedures in group I (13% versus 36%; P=0.021).",

"The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a new pediatric formulation of artemether-lumefantrine, dispersible tablet, were determined within the context of a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group study. In an exploratory approach, we compared a new pediatric formulation with the tablet formulation administered crushed in the treatment of African children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Patients were randomized to 3 different dosing groups (weights of 5 to <15 kg, 15 and <25 kg, and 25 to <35 kg). Treatment was administered twice daily over 3 days. Plasma concentrations of artemether and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), were determined at 1 and 2 h after the first dose of dispersible (n = 91) and crushed (n = 93) tablets. A full pharmacokinetic profile of lumefantrine was reconstituted on the basis of 310 (dispersible tablet) and 315 (crushed tablet) plasma samples, collected at 6 different time points (1 sample per patient). Dispersible and crushed tablets showed similar artemether and DHA maximum concentrations in plasma (C(max)) for the different body weight groups, with overall means of 175 Â± 168 and 190 Â± 168 ng/ml, respectively, for artemether and 64.7 Â± 58.1 and 63.7 Â± 65.0 ng/ml, respectively, for DHA. For lumefantrine, the population C(max) were 6.3 Î¼g/ml (dispersible tablet) and 7.7 Î¼g/ml (crushed tablet), whereas the areas under the concentration-time curves from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable plasma concentration measured were 574 and 636 Î¼g Â· h/ml, respectively. For both formulations, descriptive quintile analyses showed no apparent association between artemether/DHA C(max) and parasite clearance time or between the lumefantrine C(max) and the occurrence of adverse events or corrected QT interval changes. The results suggest that the dispersible tablet provides adequate systemic exposure to artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine in African children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.",

"African-American patients with end-stage renal disease have historically lower hemoglobin concentrations and higher requirements of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA). While disparities in health-care access may partially explain these findings, the role of variant hemoglobin, such as sickle trait, has not been investigated. To clarify this, we evaluated 154 African-American patients receiving in-center hemodialysis with available hemoglobin phenotyping. The primary exposure was any abnormal hemoglobin variant and the primary outcome of higher-dose ESA was defined as a dose of 6500 or more units per treatment. Logistic regression assessed the association between variant hemoglobin and higher-dose ESA. Covariates included age, gender, diabetes, iron parameters, intravenous iron dose, parathyroid hormone, albumin, phosphorus, body mass index, vascular access type, hospitalization/missed treatments, smoking status, alcohol abuse, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Of 33 patients with variant hemoglobin, 24 had HbAS and 9 had HbAC. Univariate odds of higher-dose ESA among those with hemoglobin variants were twice that of those with the normal HbAA phenotype (odds ratio 2.05). In multivariate models, the likelihood of higher-dose ESA had an odds ratio of 3.31 and the nature of this relationship did not change in Poisson regression or sensitivity analyses. Hence, our findings may explain, in part, the difference in ESA dosing between Caucasians and African-Americans with end-stage renal disease but await further study.",

"Preclinical trials indicate that CD34+ cells represent an effective angiogenic stem cell component. Early-phase clinical trials suggest that intramyocardial administration of autologous CD34+ cells may improve functional capacity and symptoms of angina. RENEW is a pivotal phase 3 trial designed to determine the efficacy of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized CD34+ stem cells for the treatment for patients with refractory angina and chronic myocardial ischemia. Patients (n = 444) receiving maximally tolerated antianginal therapies and lacking conventional revascularization options with Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III or IV angina and ischemia on stress testing will be randomized 2:1:1 to cell therapy (G-CSF-mediated stem cell mobilization, apheresis, and intramyocardial injection of 1 Ã 10(5) autologous CD34(+) cells/kg), active control (G-CSF-mediated stem cell mobilization, apheresis, and intramyocardial placebo injection), or open-label standard of care. The primary efficacy end point is change in exercise treadmill time in the treated vs active control patients, with 90% power to detect a 60-second difference in exercise time between cell-treated (n = 200) and active control (n = 100) patients. Key secondary end points include total number of anginal episodes per week and the incidence of independently adjudicated major adverse cardiac events and serious adverse events.

"The objective of this study was to verify the effect of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) consumption on lipid and lipoprotein levels in humans. One hundred and two individuals participated of this single-blind controlled trial. Normolipidemic (n = 15), dyslipidemic (n = 57), and hypercholesterolemic subjects on long-term statin therapy (n = 30) ingested 330 mL, 3 times/day, of green or roasted yerba mate infusions for 40 days. In normolipidemic subjects, yerba mate consumption reduced LDL-cholesterol by 8.7% (p < 0.05). Compared with the baseline period, yerba mate intake by dyslipidemic individuals for 20 and 40 days lowered LDL-cholesterol by 8.1 and 8.6% (p < 0.001) and non-HDL cholesterol by 5.4 and 6.5% (p < 0.01). After 20 days of yerba mate intake, apolipoprotein B was reduced by 6.0% (p < 0.05) and HDL-cholesterol was increased by 4.4% (p < 0.01). In all participants triglyceride levels remained unchanged. The consumption of yerba mate by hypercholesterolemic individuals on statin therapy promoted additional 10.0 and 13.1% reductions in LDL-C after 20 and 40 days, respectively (p < 0.001) and increased HDL-cholesterol by 6.2% after 40 days (p < 0.05).

"We assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a mixture of three synthetic peptides derived from the Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite protein formulated in Montanide ISA 720 or Montanide ISA 51. Forty healthy malaria-naive volunteers were allocated to five experimental groups (A-E): four groups (A-D) were immunized intramuscularly with 50 and 100 Î¼g/dose injections of a mixture of N, R, and C peptides formulated in the two different adjuvants at 0, 2, and 4 months and one group was administered placebo. Vaccines were immunogenic, safe, well tolerated, and no serious adverse events related to the vaccine occurred. Seroconversion occurred in > 90% of the vaccines and antibodies recognized the sporozoite protein on immunofluorescent antibody test. Vaccines in Montanide ISA 51 showed a higher sporozoite protein recognition and interferon production. Results encourage further testing of the vaccine protective efficacy.",

"Mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH-2) is involved in preconditioning pathways, but its role in remote ischaemic preconditioning (rIPC) is unknown. We investigated its role in animal and human models of rIPC. (i) In a rabbit model of myocardial infarction, rIPC alone reduced infarct size [69 Â± 5.8 % (n = 11) to 40 Â± 6.5 % (n = 12), P = 0.019]. However, rIPC protection was lost after pre-treatment with the ALDH-2 inhibitor cyanamide (62 Â± 7.6 % controls, n = 10, versus 61 Â± 6.9 % rIPC after cyanamide, n = 10, P > 0.05). (ii) In a forearm plethysmography model of endothelial ischaemia-reperfusion injury, 24 individuals of Asian ethnic origin underwent combined rIPC and ischaemia-reperfusion (IR). 11 had wild-type (WT) enzyme and 13 carried the Glu504Lys (ALDH2*2) polymorphism (rendering ALDH-2 functionally inactive). In WT individuals, rIPC protected against impairment of response to acetylcholine (P = 0.9), but rIPC failed to protect carriers of Glu504Lys polymorphism (P = 0.004). (iii) In a second model of endothelial IR injury, 12 individuals participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, receiving the ALDH-2 inhibitor disulfiram 600 mg od or placebo for 48 h prior to assessment of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) before and after combined rIPC and IR. With placebo, rIPC was effective with no difference in FMD before and after IR (6.18 Â± 1.03 % and 4.76 Â± 0.93 % P = 0.1), but disulfiram inhibited rIPC with a reduction in FMD after IR (7.87 Â± 1.27 % and 3.05 Â± 0.53 %, P = 0.001). This study demonstrates that ALDH-2 is involved in the rIPC pathway in three distinct rabbit and human models. This has potential implications for future clinical studies of remote conditioning.",

"Prevention of tuberculosis (TB) through vaccination would substantially reduce the global TB burden. Mtb72F/AS02 is a candidate TB vaccine shown to be immunogenic and well tolerated in PPD-negative adults. We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of Mtb72F/AS02 in Mycobacterium-primed adults (BCG-vaccinated, or infected adults who had received post-exposure chemoprophylaxis or treatment for pulmonary TB disease). In this observer-blind controlled trial, 20 BCG-vaccinated adults and 18 adults previously infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), were randomized 3:1 to receive three doses of Mtb72F/AS02 or AS02 at one-month intervals, and followed for 6 months post third vaccination. Mtb72F/AS02 was well tolerated in BCG-vaccinated adults, and tended to be more reactogenic in Mtb-infected adults. Adverse events were mainly self-limiting, resolving without sequelae. No serious adverse events were reported. The adverse events in Mtb72F/AS02 vaccinees were not clearly associated with vaccine-induced responses (as assessed by proinflammatory cytokines, total IgE and C-reactive protein levels). No Th2 T-cell responses, or vaccine-induced T-cell responses to Mtb antigens (CFP-10/PPD/ESAT-6) were detected by ICS. In both cohorts, Mtb72F/AS02 induced persistent polyfunctional Mtb72F-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses and anti-Mtb72F humoral responses. IFN-Î³ was detectable in serum one day post each vaccination. Further evaluation of the candidate vaccine, Mtb72F/AS02, is warranted.",
"Elimination of stable AF rotors and focal sources may explain freedom from AF after diverse approaches to ablation.

"Iron supplementation strategies in the developing world remain controversial because of fears of exacerbating prevalent infectious diseases. Understanding the conditions in which iron will be absorbed and incorporated into erythrocytes is therefore important. We studied Gambian children with either postmalarial or nonmalarial anemia, who were given oral iron supplements daily for 30 days. Supplements administered on days 1 and 15 contained the stable iron isotopes (57)Fe and (58)Fe, respectively, and erythrocyte incorporation was measured in blood samples drawn 14 days later. We investigated how the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin and other inflammatory/iron-related indices, all measured on the day of isotope administration, correlated with erythrocyte iron incorporation. In univariate analyses, hepcidin, ferritin, C-reactive protein, and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) strongly predicted incorporation of (57)Fe given on day 1, while hepcidin, ferritin, and sTfR/log ferritin correlated with (58)Fe incorporation. In a final multivariate model, the most consistent predictor of erythrocyte isotope incorporation was hepcidin. We conclude that under conditions of competing signals (anemia, iron deficiency, and infection), hepcidin powerfully controls use of dietary iron. We suggest that low-cost point-of-care hepcidin assays would aid iron supplementation programs in the developing world.",
"Gender disparities in tuberculosis (TB) cases are reported worldwide, and socio-cultural factors have been proposed as possible causes. To date, gender differences in treatment outcomes of TB patients remain controversial. In this prospective observational study, newly diagnosed, culture-proven TB patients from six hospitals in Taiwan were enrolled for analysis. Gender differences in demographic characteristics and treatment outcomes, including sputum conversion and on-treatment mortality, were analysed accordingly. From January 2007 through to December 2009, a total of 1059 patients were enrolled, including 819 (77.3%) males and 240 (22.7%) females. The ratio of male gender was around 50 ~ 60% in TB patients below 35 years and >80% for those older than 65 years. When compared with the female patients, the male patients were older, more likely to have the habit of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, malignancy and liver cirrhosis, and more likely to present with haemoptysis, body weight loss and pleural effusion. Regarding treatment outcomes, male gender is associated with a lower 2-month sputum culture conversion rate (78.8% vs. 89.3%, p 0.002) and higher on-treatment mortality (21.1% vs. 12.1%, p 0.002). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated significantly higher mortality in the men (p 0.005). In multivariate analysis, male gender was an independent risk factor for 2-month sputum culture un-conversion (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.12-3.41). Our findings suggest that male gender is associated with older age, more co-morbidities and worse treatment outcomes. Gender-specific strategies, including active case finding in elderly women and smoking cessation in male patients, are warranted to optimize TB management.",

"To determine the diagnostic impact of daily bedside chest radiography in comparison with digital luminescence technique (DLR; storage phosphor radiography) and conventional film screen radiography, a prospective randomized study was completed in 210 mechanically ventilated patients with a total of 420 analysed radiographs. The patients were allocated to two groups: 150 patients underwent DLR, and 60 patients underwent conventional film screen radiography. Radiological analysis was performed consensually and therapeutic efficacy was assessed by the clinicians. There was no statistical significant difference between the frequency of abnormal findings seen on DLR and conventional film screen radiography. In total, 448 abnormal findings were present in 249 of 300 DLR and 97 of 120 conventional film screen radiographs. The most common findings were signs of overhydration (41%), pleural effusion (31%), partial collapse of the lung (11%) and pneumothorax (2%). One hundred and twenty-three of 448 (27%) of these abnormal findings were thought to have a considerable impact on patient management. The high rate of abnormal findings with significant impact on patient management suggests that the use of daily bedside chest radiography may be reasonable.",

We studied 10 men and six women (mean age 38.2 +/- 11.5 yr) referred to our institution for metastatic PHEO; two patients were studied twice within a 2-yr interval. Imaging modalities included computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), [(131)I]-MIBG scintigraphy, and [(18)F]-DA PET. Fifteen of 16 patients had positive findings on CT and/or MRI consistent with the presence of pheochromocytoma. [(18)F]-DA PET was positive in all patients, but seven patients had negative [(131)I]-MIBG scans. Thirty-eight foci of uptake were shown by both [(18)F]-DA PET and [(131)I]-MIBG scintigraphy, 90 only by [(18)F]-DA PET, and 10 only by [(131)I]-MIBG; most lesions were also visible on CT/MRI. In this initial series of patients with metastatic pheochromocytoma, [(18)F]-DA PET localized PHEO in all patients and showed a large number of foci that were not imaged with [(131)I]-MIBG scintigraphy. Thus, [(18)F]-DA PET was found to be a superior imaging method in patients with metastatic PHEO, in which correct detection of disease extension often determines the most appropriate therapeutic plan and future follow-up.",

"Tuberculosis (TB) treatment can cause serious sequelae including adverse effects such as anti-TB drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDH). We performed a candidate gene-based association study between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 genes in the antioxidant pathway and ATDH susceptibility. The subjects comprised 100 Japanese patients with pulmonary TB who received a treatment regimen including isoniazid and rifampicin. Out of them, 18 patients had ATDH. Thirty-four tag SNPs in 10 genes were analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism or PCR-direct DNA sequencing. The frequencies of alleles and genotypes between patients with and without ATDH were compared in three different genetic models. Statistical analyses revealed that a C/C genotype at rs11080344 in NOS2A, a C/C genotype at rs2070401 in BACH1, and a G/A or A/A genotype at rs4720833 in MAFK independently conferred ATDH susceptibility. Remarkably, the association of the latter two tag SNPs with ATDH susceptibility was highly statistically significant (PÂ =Â 0.0006) with an odds ratio of 9.730. This study is the first report to demonstrate that NOS2A, BACH1, and MAFK appear to be genetic determinants of ATDH in Japanese patients with TB. Furthermore, a combination of BACH1 and MAFK polymorphisms may be useful as new biomarkers to identify high-risk Japanese TB patients for ATDH.",

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term safety and tolerability of an antimalarial herbal medicinal product (PR 259 CT1) consisting of a quantified 80 % ethanol extract from the stem bark of Nauclea pobeguinii when given orally to healthy adult male volunteers. The amount of the major alkaloid strictosamide in the extract was determined by a validated HPLC method and was shown to be 5.6 %. The herbal preparation was formulated in a gelatine capsule form containing 500 mg of PCR 259 CT1. A sample of 15 healthy male volunteers, selected using the Lot Quality Assurance of Sampling (LQAS) method, was eligible for inclusion after fulfillment of the inclusion criteria and clinical examination by a physician. The volunteers were treated in an outpatient clinic with a drug regimen of two 500 mg capsules three times daily (each eight hours) for seven days, during meals. Safety and tolerability were monitored clinically, haematologically, biochemically and by electrocardiographic (ECG) examination at days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14. Adverse effects were recorded by self-reporting of the participants or by detection of abnormalities in clinical examinations by a physician. The oral administration of PR 259 CT1 at high doses of 2 Ã 500 mg/capsule/day for 7 days was found to induce no significant changes in the concentration levels of all investigated haematological, biochemical, electrocardiogram and vital sign parameters and physical characteristics after 14 days of treatment compared to those seen in the baseline data. The concentration levels of all evaluated parameters were within the normal limits as reported in the literature. All adverse events noted were mild and self-resolving including increase of appetite (33 %), headache (20 %) and nausea (20 %). Other minor side effects were insomnia, somnolence and asthenia (7 %). Thus, PR 259 CT1 presented a significant safety and tolerability in healthy volunteers to allow its further development by starting a phase II clinical trial.",
"Inward rectifier potassium currents I(K1) and acetylcholine activated I(K,ACh) are implicated in atrial fibrillation (AF) pathophysiology. In chronic AF (cAF), I(K,ACh) develops a receptor-independent, constitutively active component that together with increased I(K1) is considered to support maintenance of AF. Here, we tested whether class I (propafenone, flecainide) and class III (dofetilide, AVE0118) antiarrhythmic drugs inhibit atrial I(K1) and I(K,ACh) in patients with and without cAF. I(K1) and I(K,ACh) were measured with voltage clamp technique in atrial myocytes from 58 sinus rhythm (SR) and 35 cAF patients. The M-receptor agonist carbachol (CCh; 2 microM) was employed to activate I(K,ACh). In SR, basal current was not affected by either drug indicating no effect of these compounds on I(K1). In contrast, all tested drugs inhibited CCh-activated I(K,ACh) in a concentration-dependent manner. In cAF, basal current was confirmed to be larger than in SR (at -80 mV, -15.2 +/- 1.2 pA/pF, n = 88/35 vs. -6.5 +/- 0.4 pA/pF, n = 194/58 [myocytes/patients]; P < 0.05), whereas CCh-activated I(K,ACh) was smaller (-4.1 +/- 0.5 pA/pF vs. -9.5 +/- 0.6 pA/pF; P < 0.05). In cAF, receptor-independent constitutive I(K,ACh) contributes to increased basal current, which was reduced by flecainide and AVE0118 only. This may be due to inhibition of constitutively active I(K,ACh) channels. In cAF, all tested drugs reduced CCh-activated I(K,ACh). We conclude that in cAF, flecainide and AVE0118 reduce receptor-independent, constitutively active I(K,ACh), suggesting that they may block I(K,ACh) channels, whereas propafenone and dofetilide likely inhibit M-receptors. The efficacy of flecainide to terminate AF may in part result from blockade of I(K,ACh).",

"Endometrial cancer is primarily a hormonally mediated disease. As such, factors that mediate or reflect exposure to estrogens, or that mediate response to such exposure, may plausibly be associated with endometrial cancer risk. History of migraines, another hormonally mediated condition, has recently been associated with a reduced risk of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer; however, the relationship between migraines and endometrial cancer has not previously been explored. We evaluated the relationship between migraine history and endometrial cancer risk in postmenopausal women, considering also the potential impact of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, given the relationship of NSAIDs to hormones and to migraine history. We identified 93,384 women participating in the Women's Health Initiative prospective cohort who had an intact uterus at the time of study entry. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, we assessed risk of endometrial cancer during study follow-up according to history of migraines and according to current NSAID use at the time of study entry, adjusting for age, study arm, race, and hormone therapy use. We also evaluated interaction in these associations by body mass index. Having a history of migraines was not associated with endometrial cancer risk [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75-1.11], regardless of body mass index (BMI) or NSAID use status. Similarly, current NSAID use was not associated with endometrial cancer risk (HR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88-1.16), regardless of BMI. Migraine history and NSAID use do not appear to be associated with risk of endometrial cancer.",

"Many of the risk factors for stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF) are also important risk factors for bleeding. Wetested the hypothesis that the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores (used for stroke risk assessment) could be used to predict serious bleeding, and that these scores would compare well against the HAS-BLED score, which is a specific risk score designed for bleeding risk assessment. From the AMADEUS trial, we focused on the trial's primary safety outcome for serious bleeding, which was "any clinically relevant bleeding". The predictive value of HAS-BLED/CHADS2/CHA2DS2-VASc were compared by area under the curve (AUC, a measure of the c-index) and the Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI). Of 2,293 patients on VKA, 251 (11%) experienced at least one episode of "any clinically relevant bleeding" during an average 429 days follow up period. Incidence of "any clinically relevant bleeding" rose with increasing HAS-BLED/CHADS2/CHA2DS2-VASc scores, but was statistically significant only for HAS-BLED (p<0.0001). Only HAS-BLED demonstrated significant discriminatory performance for "any clinically relevant bleeding" (AUC 0.60, p<0.0001). There were significant AUC-differences between HAS-BLED (which had the highest AUC) and both CHADS2 (p<0.001) and CHA2DS2VASc (p=0.001). The HAS-BLED score also demonstrated significant NRI for the outcome of "any clinically relevant bleeding" when compared with CHADS2 (p=0.001) and CHA2DS2-VASc (p=0.04). In conclusion, the HAS-BLED score demonstrated significant discriminatory performance for "any clinically relevant bleeding" in anticoagulated patients with AF, whilst the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores did not. Bleeding risk assessment should be made using a specific bleeding risk score such as HAS-BLED, and the stroke risk scores such as CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc scores should not be used.",

"Although some studies suggest that a linear dose-response relationship exists between exercise and insulin sensitivity, the exercise dose required to enhance pancreatic Î²-cell function is unknown. Thirty-five older obese adults with prediabetes underwent a progressive 12-wk supervised exercise intervention (5 days/wk for 60 min at ~85% HRmax). Insulin and C-peptide responses to an OGTT were used to define the first- and second-phase disposition index (DI; Î²-cell function = glucose-stimulated insulin secretion Ã clamp-derived insulin sensitivity). Maximum oxygen consumption (Vo2max) and body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography) were also measured before and after the intervention. Exercise dose was computed using Vo2/heart-rate derived linear regression equations. Subjects expended 474.5 Â± 8.8 kcal/session (2,372.5 Â± 44.1 kcal/wk) during the intervention and lost ~8% body weight. Exercise increased first- and second-phase DI (P < 0.05), and these changes in DI were linearly related to exercise dose (DIfirst phase: r = 0.54, P < 0.001; DIsecond phase: r = 0.56, P = 0.0005). Enhanced DI was also associated with increased Vo2max (DIfirst phase: r = 0.36, P = 0.04; DIsecond phase: r = 0.41, P < 0.02) but not lower body fat (DIfirst phase: r = -0.21, P = 0.25; DIsecond phase: r = -0.30, P = 0.10) after training. Low baseline DI predicted an increase in DI after the intervention (DIfirst phase: r = -0.37; DIsecond phase: r = -0.41, each P < 0.04). Thus, exercise training plus weight loss increased pancreatic Î²-cell function in a linear dose-response manner in adults with prediabetes. Our data suggest that higher exercise doses (i.e., >2,000 kcal/wk) are necessary to enhance Î²-cell function in adults with poor insulin secretion capacity.",

"Vitamin K has been related to cardiovascular disease and cancer risk. However, data on total mortality are scarce. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the dietary intake of different types of vitamin K and mortality in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular disease risk. A prospective cohort analysis was conducted in 7216 participants from the PREDIMED (PrevenciÃ³n con Dieta MediterrÃ¡nea) study (median follow-up of 4.8 y). Energy and nutrient intakes were evaluated using a validated 137-item food frequency questionnaire. Dietary vitamin K intake was calculated annually using the USDA food composition database and other published sources. Deaths were ascertained by an end-point adjudication committee unaware of the dietary habits of participants after they had reviewed medical records and linked up to the National Death Index. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to assess the RR of mortality. Energy-adjusted baseline dietary phylloquinone intake was inversely associated with a significantly reduced risk of cancer and all-cause mortality after controlling for potential confounders (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.96; and HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.90, respectively). In longitudinal assessments, individuals who increased their intake of phylloquinone or menaquinone during follow-up had a lower risk of cancer (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.95; and HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.64, respectively) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.73; and HR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.73, respectively) than individuals who decreased or did not change their intake. Also, individuals who increased their intake of dietary phylloquinone had a lower risk of cardiovascular mortality risk (HR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.86). However, no association between changes in menaquinone intake and cardiovascular mortality was observed (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.44, 1.29). An increase in dietary intake of vitamin K is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular, cancer, or all-cause mortality in a Mediterranean population at high cardiovascular disease risk. This trial was registered at http://www.controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN35739639.",

"Atrial fibrillation patients (n = 955) with > or =1 additional risk factor for stroke were randomized to receive AZD0837 (150, 300, or 450 mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily) or VKA (international normalized ratio 2-3, target 2.5) for 3-9 months. Approximately 30% of patients were naÃ¯ve to VKA treatment. Total bleeding events were similar or lower in all AZD0837 groups (5.3-14.7%, mean exposure 138-145 days) vs. VKA (14.5%, mean exposure 161 days), with fewer clinically relevant bleeding events on AZD0837 150 and 300 mg once daily. Adverse events were similar between treatment groups; with AZD0837, the most common were gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. diarrhoea, flatulence, or nausea). d-Dimer, used as a biomarker of thrombogenesis, decreased in all groups in VKA-naÃ¯ve subjects with treatment, whereas in VKA pre-treated patients, d-dimer levels started low and remained low in all groups. As expected, only a few strokes or systemic embolic events occurred. In the AZD0837 groups, mean S-creatinine increased by approximately 10% from baseline and returned to baseline following treatment cessation. The frequency of serum alanine aminotransferase > or =3x upper limit of normal was similar for AZD0837 and VKA.",

"Plasmodium vivax malaria, though benign, has now become a matter of concern due to recent reports of life-threatening severity and development of parasite resistance to different antimalarial drugs. The magnitude of the problem is still undetermined. The present study was undertaken to determine the in vivo efficacy of chloroquine (CQ) and chloroquine plus primaquine in P. vivax malaria in Kolkata and polymorphisms in the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes. A total of 250 patients with P. vivax monoinfection were recruited and randomized into two groups, A and B; treated with chloroquine and chloroquine plus primaquine, respectively; and followed up for 42 days according to the WHO protocol of 2009. Data were analyzed using per-protocol analyses. We assessed polymorphisms of the pvmdr1 and pvcrt-o genes by a DNA-sequencing method. Out of the 250 patients recruited, 204 completed a 42-day follow-up period, 101 in group A and 103 in group B. In group A, the non-PCR-corrected efficacy of CQ was 99% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.944 to 1.00), and in group B, all cases were classified as adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR). Day 3 positivity was observed in 11 (5.3%) cases. No specific mutation pattern was recorded in the pvcrt-o gene. Eight nonsynonymous mutations were found in the pvmdr1 gene, three of which were new. The Y976F mutation was not detected in any isolate. Chloroquine, either alone or in combination with primaquine, is still effective against P. vivax malaria in the study area. (The study protocol was registered in CTRI [Clinical Trial Registry-India] of the Indian council of Medical Research under registration no. CTRI/2011/09/002031.).",

"Malaria is still responsible for 10% of the total disease burden in Africa. This study was an empirical investigation addressing the extent to which, and the ways in which, sociocultural, family-based, demographic and economic circumstances in a poor rural African environment influence levels of active malaria infection risk awareness. Face-to-face interviews were conducted and the questions included both open-ended questions allowing for unprompted replies and closed fixed-answer alternative (prompted) items. The adult female responsible for the day-to-day care of the children in 156 homesteads (60 in each of two malaria villages and 36 in a reference village) was interviewed. The families received financial assistance but little physical support from the fathers. Unemployment, poverty, crime and clean water were perceived as the main, unprompted threats, and everyday awareness appeared to exclude the potentially serious disease threats of malaria. Only when malaria was prompted did the concerns rise to 52% and 38% in the sprayed villages. The apparent discrepancy between actual daily and potential future threats significantly increases the difficulty of mobilising communities for preventive action regarding potential threats. The lack of community involvement in an existing community-passive malaria control system may become a problem when promoting new/additional measures to reduce exposure to indoor residual spraying chemicals.",

"Studies on baboons and preliminary observations in three patients with sickle cell anemia (SS) suggested that high doses of pulse administered recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) stimulate F-reticulocyte production. We now report on the administration of rHuEPO in a double-blind format to ascertain frequency of response and potential precipitation of side effects. Ten patients were enrolled, but one was discontinued due to the indication of a blood transfusion. Of the other nine, five received rHuEPO in escalating doses (from 400 to 1,500 U per kg twice daily [BID] per week), alternating with a placebo, in blinded fashion. The second group, consisting of four patients, followed an identical protocol (except starting dose was 1,000 U/Kg, BID per week) and were iron supplemented during treatment. The criterion of response was a transient doubling (as a minimum) of the steady-state F-reticulocyte level. We found that none of the five patients in the first group responded to rHuEPO, and two of them became iron deficient, as judged by a significant decrease in ferritin. Of the second group, four patients responded with F-reticulocyte increases. In three patients, open label administration of rHuEPO confirmed the effect. We observed seven painful episodes during this study, two during the EPO administration and five during the placebo arm. Three patients were phlebotomized because the hemoglobin level increased 1.5 g/dL more than steady-state levels. Of the six patients followed-up by percent dense cell determinations, one exhibited increased levels during periods of the treatment, whereas the other five showed no change. No anti-rHuEPO antibodies were detected. We conclude that rHuEPO can stimulate F-reticulocyte response in some patients with sickle cell anemia, without apparent negative clinical side effects. The state of iron stores may be critical. Whether higher doses of rHuEPO and/or a different regimen might induce sustained F cells and fetal hemoglobin increases remains to be determined.",

"Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) are at increased risk for cardiovascular events compared with patients undergoing non-LAD PCI. We assessed the impact of bivalirudin and paclitaxel-eluting stenting (PES) in patients with STEMI who underwent LAD PCI. In the HORIZONS-AMI trial, 1,445 patients had LAD PCI and 1,884 patients had non-LAD PCI. The 3-year composite rates of death, reinfarction, stroke, or ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization were significantly higher in patients who underwent LAD PCI compared with non-LAD PCI (24.0% vs 20.6%, hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.39, p = 0.013), driven by a statistically significant increase in cardiac death (5.4% vs 2.7%, HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.86, p = 0.001). For patients who underwent LAD PCI, treatment with bivalirudin resulted in significantly lower rates of cardiac death (3.8% vs 6.8%, HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89, p = 0.01), reinfarction (5.3% vs 9.5%, HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.83, p = 0.004), and major bleeding events (7.3% vs 11.8%, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.86, p = 0.004) compared with unfractionated heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Randomization to PES compared with bare-metal stenting resulted in a significant lower rate of target vessel revascularization (13.2% vs 19.8%, HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.86, p = 0.003) with no significant differences in stent thrombosis, reinfarction, or death. In conclusion, in patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI of LAD, the use of bivalirudin was associated with a reduction in mortality and bleeding rates at 3 years. PES reduced revascularization rates in this population but did not have a significant impact on mortality.",

"The diagnosis of asymptomatic abdominal tuberculosis,without characteristic laboratory and radiologic findings, is difficult. We therefore investigated the role of diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with suspected peritoneal tuberculosis(PTB). Patients admitted to Hamad General Hospital, Qatar,who underwent laparoscopic peritoneal biopsy for suspected PTB from January 2004 to December 2010 were retrospectively analysed. Factors assessed included patient age, sex, symptoms,clinical signs, CT scan findings, laparoscopic findings andhistopathological diagnosis. A total of 41 patients, 33 males(80.5%) and 8 females (19.5%), of mean age 31 years, underwent laparoscopic peritoneal biopsy for suspected PTB duringthe study period. Abdominal pain was the most common presenting symptom, observed in 33 (80.5%) patients.Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed as citesin 37 patients (90%), bowel nodules in 22 (54%), peritoneal thickening and nodules in 37 (90%) and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes in 11 (27%).

"In women, cardiac deaths attributable to tobacco exposure have reached the same high levels as men. Normally, sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) fluctuates according to the menstrual phase, but in habitual smokers, SNA levels remain constant. Our purpose is to extend these observations to other groups of women exposed to tobacco smoke and to explore potential mechanisms. We hypothesize that women exposed to secondhand smoke, but not former smokers, have nonfluctuating SNA compared with never smokers, and that impaired baroreflex suppression of SNA, and/or heightened central SNA responses, underlie this nonfluctuating SNA. We also hypothesize that female smokers have impaired nocturnal blood pressure dipping, normally mediated by modulation of SNA. In 49 females (19 never, 12 current, 9 former, 9 passive smokers), SNA was recorded (microneurography) during high- and low-hormone ovarian phases at rest, during pharmacological baroreflex testing, and during the cold pressor test (CPT). Twenty-four hour blood pressure (BP) monitoring was performed. Current and passive smokers, but not former smokers, had a nonfluctuating pattern of SNA, unlike never smokers in whom SNA varied with the menstrual phase. Baroreflex control of SNA was significantly blunted in current smokers, independent of menstrual phase. In passive smokers, SNA response to CPT was markedly increased. Nondipping was unexpectedly high in all groups. SNA does not vary during the menstrual cycle in active and passive smokers, unlike never and former smokers. Baroreflex control of SNA is blunted in current smokers, whereas SNA response to CPT is heightened in passive smokers. Smoking cessation is associated with return of the altered SNA pattern to normal.",

"The toxicity of oral zinc was investigated in patients hospitalized for chronic leg ulcers.

Both groups had serum zinc concentrations in the lower normal range. One group was treated with 3 daily doses of 220 mg oral zinc sulfate and the other with placebo, and hence, untoward effects of zinc should have become manifest in the zinc-treated group. This was not the case. Therefore, oral zinc appears to be well tolerated clinically and does not cause hematological, renal or hepatic toxicity. In view of the increasing interest in and range of indications for zinc, particularly in conditions associated with cellular immunological hyporeactivity, this finding is a prerequisite for the institution of clinical zinc therapy.",
"Thailand's implementation of the Directly Observed Treatment, Short course (DOTS) strategy to increase tuberculosis (TB) control program efficacy has not achieved the World Health Organization (WHO) TB key targets. We defined two TB control models in the study. Patients in Model 1 were treated with a conventional DOTS strategy and in Model 2, patients were treated the same as Model method 1 but were given a phone call reminder to take their medication. Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and non-MDR-TB patients were randomized into either Model 1 or 2. Treatment outcomes were given as cure rates, completion rates, failure rates or success rates at 18 months in the MDR-TB group and 6 months in the non-MDR-TB group. The sputum conversion rate at 1 month were evaluated for both groups. In the MDR-TB group, the sputum conversion rate was 20% (95% CI 8-45) in Model 1 and 90% (95% CI 73-98) in Model 2 (p < 0.001). In the non-MDR-TB group, the sputum conversion rate was 52% (95% CI 36-70) in Model 1 and 37% (95% CI 22-56) in Model 2 although the difference was not significant (p = 0.221).

Type 1 diabetes was found to be associated with Cr (p = 0.02), Mn (p < 0.001), Ni (p < 0.001), Pb (p = 0.02), and Zn (p < 0.001) deficiency, and type 2 diabetes with Cr (p = 0.014), Mn (p < 0.001), and Ni (p < 0.001) deficiency. These deficiencies were appreciated also subdividing the understudied patients for gender and age groups. Furthermore, in type 1 diabetes, there was a positive correlation between Pb and age (p < 0.001, Ï = 0.400) and Pb and BMI (p < 0.001, Ï = 0.309), while a negative correlation between Fe and age (p = 0.002, Ï = -0.218). In type 2 diabetes, there was a negative correlation between Fe and age (p = 0.017, Ï = -0.294) and Fe and BMI (p = 0.026, Ï = -0.301). Thus, these elements may play a role in both forms of diabetes and combined mineral supplementations could have beneficial effects.",

"An epinephrine infusion of 6 mug/min decreased the rapid insulin response to a 5 g glucose pulse by 96% (P < 0.001) compared with the preinfusion control. In contrast when an identical epinephrine infusion was superimposed on a prolonged glucose infusion, elevated steady-state insulin levels did not decrease, but increased from 26.9 +/-6 (mean +/-SD, muU/ml) to 56.8 +/-15 muU/ml (P < 0.05) in parallel with the epinephrine-induced hyperglycemia. Thus epinephrine inhibition of insulin secretion was observed during acute but not chronic glucose stimulation. To evaluate further the insulin responses during a prolonged glucose infusion, a 5 g glucose pulse was given before and 60 min later during a concomitant epinephrine infusion. Although the acute insulin response to the first glucose pulse was observed during the elevated steady-state glucose and insulin levels associated with the glucose infusion, epinephrine again inhibited the acute insulin response to the subsequent 5 g glucose pulse by 91% (P < 0.01). Thus epinephrine appears to inhibit selectively the rapid insulin response to glucose but not to influence insulin output stimulated by prolonged hyperglycemia. These observations provide further evidence for a model of insulin secretion which includes a small storage pool available for immediate release to a glucose challenge and a more slowly responding pool regulating insulin secretion in the basal and steady state.",

"Linezolid is identified as an effective drug with which to treat patients failing multidrug-resistant (MDR)-tuberculosis (TB) treatment. However, cost and safety are the concerns. In India, the average price of a 600-mg pill of linezolid is less than one US dollar, much cheaper than most of the third-line drugs. A prospective study of 29 MDR-TB treatment failure patients (16 with laboratory-proven extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB and the remaining 13 with MDR-TB with resistance to any quinolone but sensitive to injectables) was carried out in Delhi, India. All patients received daily unsupervised therapy with linezolid, one injectable agent, one fluoroquinolone and two or more other drugs. Patients received a median of six anti-mycobacterial agents. Besides linezolid, capreomycin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and amoxycillin-clavulanic acid were used in 41.4%, 58.6%, 41.4%, and 79.3% of patients. Out of a total of 29 patients, 89.7% patients achieved sputum smear and culture conversion; 72.4% showed interim favourable outcome; 10.3% died, 6.8% failed and 10.3% patients defaulted. Linezolid had to be stopped in three (10.3%) patients due to adverse reactions. The outcome of treatment of 16 XDR-TB patients was comparable to the other 13 MDR-TB patients. Linezolid is an effective, cheap and relatively safe drug for patients failing MDR-TB treatment, including those with confirmed XDR-TB.",
"Poor adherence to tuberculosis (TB) treatment hinders the individual's recovery and threatens public health. Currently, directly observed therapy (DOT) is the standard of care; however, high sustaining costs limit its availability, creating a need for more practical adherence confirmation methods. Techniques such as video monitoring and devices to time-register the opening of pill bottles are unable to confirm actual medication ingestions. A novel approach developed by Proteus Digital Health, Inc. consists of an ingestible sensor and an on-body wearable sensor; together, they electronically confirm unique ingestions and record the date/time of the ingestion. A feasibility study using an early prototype was conducted in active TB patients to determine the system's accuracy and safety in confirming co-ingestion of TB medications with sensors. Thirty patients completed 10 DOT visits and 1,080 co-ingestion events; the system showed 95.0% (95% CI 93.5-96.2%) positive detection accuracy, defined as the number of detected sensors divided by the number of transmission capable sensors administered. The specificity was 99.7% [95% CI 99.2-99.9%] based on three false signals recorded by receivers. The system's identification accuracy, defined as the number of correctly identified ingestible sensors divided by the number of sensors detected, was 100%. Of 11 adverse events, four were deemed related or possibly related to the device; three mild skin rashes and one complaint of nausea. The system's positive detection accuracy was not affected by the subjects' Body Mass Index (pâ=â0.7309). Study results suggest the system is capable of correctly identifying ingestible sensors with high accuracy, poses a low risk to users, and may have high patient acceptance. The system has the potential to confirm medication specific treatment compliance on a dose-by-dose basis. When coupled with mobile technology, the system could allow wirelessly observed therapy (WOT) for monitoring TB treatment as a replacement for DOT.",

"Previous studies with the malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS02(A) in young children in a malaria endemic area of Mozambique have shown it to have a promising safety profile and to reduce the risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection and disease. In this study, we assessed the antibody responses to the P. falciparum and hepatitis B components of the RTS,S/AS02(A) vaccine over a 45 months surveillance period in a large phase IIb trial which included 2022 children aged 1-4 years at recruitment. The RTS,S/AS02(A) vaccine induced high anti-circumsporozoite antibody levels with at least 96% of children remaining seropositive during the entire follow-up period. IgG titers decayed over the first 6 months of follow-up to about 25% of the initial level, but still remained 30-fold higher until month 45 compared to controls. Children with higher levels of naturally acquired immunity at baseline, assessed by blood stage indirect fluorescent antibody test, had slightly higher anti-circumsporozoite levels, after adjusting for the effect of age. The RTS,S/AS02(A) vaccine also induced high levels of anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibodies (seroprotection >97%). RTS,S/AS02(A) vaccine is immunogenic and induces long-lasting anti-circumsporozoite antibodies, persisting at least 42 months after immunization. These antibodies may play a role in protection against malaria.",
"Lung surfactant replacement has been tested clinically in recent years. In this study the outcome of 31 premature infants with moderate to severe neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) treated with surfactant was compared to that of 74 prematures with RDS treated conventionally by positive pressure ventilation and supportive care. The groups were well matched for gestational age, birthweight, sex, and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min. Surfactant treatment resulted in a significant decrease in mortality--from 36.6% in the untreated group to 12.9% in the surfactant-treated group (P < 0.04). This improvement in survival was seen also in prematures with a birthweight < 1,000 g; in the untreated group mortality was 57.6% compared to 23.5% in the treated group (P < 0.05). The incidence of pneumothorax was lower in the treated group--42% vs. 13% (P < 0.01). Surfactant treatment resulted in a trend of more survivors without bronchopulmonary dysplasia or intraventricular hemorrhage, even though surfactant therapy did not change the incidence of either.",
"Heterologous prime-boost strategies hold promise for vaccination against tuberculosis. However, the T-cell characteristics required for protection are not known. We proposed that boost vaccines should induce long-lived functional and phenotypic changes to T cells primed by Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) and/or natural exposure to mycobacteria. We characterized changes among specific CD4(+) T cells after vaccination with the MVA85A vaccine in adults, adolescents, and children. CD4(+) T cells identified with Ag85A peptide-bearing HLA class II tetramers were characterized by flow cytometry. We also measured proliferative potential and cytokine expression of Ag85A-specific CD4(+) T cells. During the effector phase, MVA85A-induced specific CD4(+) T cells coexpressed IFN-Î³ and IL-2, skin homing integrins, and the activation marker CD38. This was followed by contraction and a transition to predominantly IL-2-expressing, CD45RA(-) CCR7(+) CD27(+) or CD45RA(+) CCR7(+) CD27(+) specific CD4(+) T cells. These surface phenotypes were similar to Ag85A-specific T cells prior to MVA85A. However, functional differences were observed postvaccination: specific proliferative capacity was markedly higher after 6-12 months than before vaccination. Our data suggest that MVA85A vaccination may modulate Ag85A-specific CD4(+) T-cell function, resulting in greater recall potential. Importantly, surface phenotypes commonly used as proxies for memory T-cell function did not associate with functional effects of vaccination.",

"Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience painful crises that often require admission to the emergency department (ED) for pain management. Factors such as ED overcrowding and negative perception and stigmatization of SCD may impact patients' perceptions of the quality of pain management in the ED. Data from a multisite prospective cohort study was assessed to determine whether demographic (age and sex), clinical (time to administration of initial analgesia, number of analgesic doses, discharge disposition, and clinical site), or interpersonal factors (separately measured perceptions of being treated with trust and respect by ED triage nurses, nurses, and physicians) were associated with patient ratings of their pain management in the ED. Patients were adults with SCD seen at 3 EDs (2 urban and 1 rural). Demographic and clinical information was derived from medical record review; interpersonal and ED pain management ratings were derived from interviews conducted 1 week post ED visit. A total of 209 interviews by 98 patients were analyzed. Results indicated significant differences among the ED sites on the demographic, clinical, and interpersonal factors. Overall, patients reported being treated with trust and respect by ED clinicians. Adjusted logistic regression analyses indicated that ED clinical site 1 (odds ratio [OR], 10.42; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.44-7.36) and being treated with trust and respect by the ED physician (OR, 25.53; 95% CI, 2.07-314.96) predicted good ED pain management ratings. Interpersonal health care experiences may be an important indicator of patient satisfaction and quality of care received by patients with SCD in the ED.",

"Patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) can require antiarrhythmic drugs to manage arrhythmias and prevent device shocks. We sought to determine the prevalence, clinical correlates, and institutional variation in the use of antiarrhythmic drugs over time after ICD implantation. From the ICD Registry (2006 to 2011), we analyzed the trends in the use of antiarrhythmic agents prescribed at hospital discharge for patients undergoing first-time ICD placement. The patient, provider, and facility level variables associated with antiarrhythmic use were determined using multivariate logistic regression models. A median odds ratio was calculated to assess the hospital-level variation in the use of antiarrhythmic drugs. Of the cohort (n = 500,995), 15% had received an antiarrhythmic drug at discharge. The use of class III agents increased modestly (13.9% to 14.9%, p <0.01). Amiodarone was the most commonly prescribed drug (82%) followed by sotalol (10%). Among the subgroups, the greatest increase in prescribing was for patients who had received a secondary prevention ICD (26% in 2006% and 30% in 2011, p <0.01) or with a history of ventricular tachycardia (23% to 27%, p <0.01). The median odds ratio for antiarrhythmic prescription was 1.45, indicating that 2 randomly selected hospitals would have had a 45% difference in the odds of treating identical patients with an antiarrhythmic drug. In conclusion, antiarrhythmic drug use, particularly class III antiarrhythmic drugs, is common among ICD recipients at hospital discharge and varies by hospital, suggesting an influence from local treatment patterns. The observed hospital variation suggests a role for augmentation of clinical guidelines regarding the use of antiarrhythmic drugs for patients undergoing implantation of an ICD.",
"There is clinical variability in the presentation of sickle cell disease among Indians. Vaso-occlusive crisis is common among non-tribal patients. Hydroxyurea, induces fetal hemoglobin (HbF) synthesis and reduces the clinical severity of sickle cell disease but individual patients have a variable response. This study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in Indians with severe manifestations where the beta(s) gene is linked to the Arab-Indian haplotype and is associated with higher HbF levels. Seventy-seven patients (29 adult sickle homozygous, 25 pediatric sickle homozygous, 23 adult sickle beta-thalassemia) selected for hydroxyurea therapy were evaluated for clinical, hematological, biochemical and genetic parameters and were followed for 24 months. Ninety-eight point seven percent of the sickle chromosomes were linked to the Arab-Indian haplotype, 27% of patients had associated alpha thalassemia and 65% were Xmn I +/+. Seventy-eight percent of the patients had no further crises after starting hydroxyurea. This effect was accompanied by a significant increase in HbF (p<0.001), but this increase was variable in individual cases. There was also an increase in gamma gene mRNA expression in the few cases so studied. Hemoglobin levels increased significantly (p<0.001) resulting in the cessation of blood transfusions. Leucopoenia was observed in one patient. Hydroxyurea was effective in reducing the clinical severity in Indian patients who initially had higher HbF levels and the presence of ameliorating factors, such as alpha-thalassemia and the Xmn I polymorphism. Hydroxyurea therapy with careful monitoring can thus change the quality of life of Indians with sickle cell disease.",

"Chronic migraine is a common and debilitating headache syndrome. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), a potent toxin produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum, used largely for treatment of disorders associated with increased muscle tone and hyperidrosis, has been recently used for patients suffering from chronic migraine. In this study, two groups of patients were treated with different dosages of BoNT A to verify the efficacy for chronic migraine. The results confirmed the efficacy of BoNT A when used at the dosage of 150 U. In the second group of patients treated with 100 U, results were not significant. Although these results are preliminary, they led to intense efforts to evaluate the analgesic properties of BoNT A and to assess their clinical applicability.",

"High levels of the novel inflammatory marker YKL-40 have been demonstrated in inflammatory environments and in remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Both are key components in atrial wall remodeling in atrial fibrillation (AF). We studied the relation between rhythm outcome after electrical cardioversion (ECV) for persistent AF and serum levels of YKL-40. A secondary point of interest was a potential effect of the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan on YKL-40 levels. In the Candesartan in the Prevention of Relapsing Atrial Fibrillation (CAPRAF) study, 171 patients with persistent AF were randomized to receive candesartan 8mg once daily or placebo for 3-6 weeks before ECV and candesartan 16mg once daily or placebo for 6 months after ECV. Serum levels of YKL-40 were measured in fasting blood samples collected at baseline and at end of the study. Mean age was 64Â±11 years, and 39 (22.8%) were women. Sinus rhythm was maintained for 6 months after ECV in 41 (23.9%). Baseline levels of YKL-40 were significantly correlated to age (Spearmans rho; rs=0.442; p<0.001), CHA2DS2-VASc(1) score (rs=0.256; p<0.001) and left atrial diameter (rs=0.185; p=0.017). By use of Kaplan-Meier quartile analysis of baseline YKL-40 levels, no relation between YKL-40 levels and risk of AF recurrence was found. End of study YKL-40 levels were unchanged from baseline, both in patients with AF recurrence and those maintaining sinus rhythm for 6 months. Treatment with candesartan had no influence on serum YKL-40 levels.",

"The Atrial Fibrillation: Focus on Effective Clinical Treatment Strategies (AFFECTS) Registry was designed to examine atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment by United States cardiologists in the context of the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and European Society of Cardiology guidelines after recent landmark clinical trials. Most patients in AFFECTS had AF without clinically significant structural heart disease or only uncomplicated hypertension. Among the all-enrolled population (n = 1,461), initial treatment strategies assigned were rhythm control in 64% and rate control in 36%. Among patients with either paroxysmal (n = 1,165) or persistent (n = 273) AF, 67% and 55%, respectively, were assigned rhythm control. The trend to assign rhythm control as the initial treatment goal decreased with age. In the rhythm-control group, most patients (74%) also received a rate-control agent during the registry, while 25% of those assigned to rate control received antiarrhythmic drugs. Most first prescriptions of antiarrhythmic drugs were for first-line therapy compliant with 2001 (76%) and 2006 (86%) guidelines. Most second prescriptions were for first-line therapies as well. Rates of serious adverse events were low. In conclusion, data from this study provide insight into community treatment patterns in patients with AF, most without clinically significant structural heart disease or with only uncomplicated hypertension.",

"Novel malaria monitoring and evaluation (M&E) tools are urgently needed to complement the current "gold standard" Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS). Rapid up scaling of malaria control efforts is resulting in substantial reductions in malaria burden across sub-Saharan Africa. As transmission goes down, timely, accurate, sub-national, and district level burden estimates are needed to guide increasingly targeted control efforts in remaining hotspot areas. To test a novel district level M&E tool, we have conducted a continuous ("rolling") MIS (rMIS) since May 2010 covering 50 villages in Chikhwawa district in southern Malawi, essentially adapting an existing cross-sectional evaluation tool into a continuous monitoring tool. Here, we report on our experience after completing the first full year of monthly data collection focusing on the methods, operational aspects, and estimated costs of rMIS in a programmatic setting. The potential applicability of this promising M&E approach for district-level program managers and control efforts is discussed.",
"Migraine is frequently comorbid with depression. There appear to be common aetiological factors for both disorders, but the aetiology of migraine within depressed patients, in particular the significance of aura, has been little studied. A large sample of concordantly depressed sibling pairs [the Depression-Network (DeNT) sample] was assessed as having migraine with aura (MA), migraine without aura (MoA), probable migraine or no migraine according to International Headache Society guidelines. Correlations between siblings' migraine status were used to assess the nature of familial liability to migraine. A multiple threshold isocorrelational model fit best, in which different syndromes are conceptualized as different severities of one underlying dimension rather than as having separate aetiologies. Thus, MA and MoA were found to be different forms of the same disorder, with MA occupying the more extreme end of the spectrum of liability. Implications for our understanding of the relationship between migraine and depression are discussed.",
"This was a 52-week, double-blind, extension study in which COPD patients previously treated with twice-daily (BID) aclidinium bromide 200 Î¼g or 400 Î¼g during a 12-week lead-in study (ACCORD COPD I) continued the same treatment, while patients previously receiving placebo were rerandomized (1:1) to aclidinium 200 Î¼g or 400 Î¼g BID. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of aclidinium treatment. Efficacy outcomes included bronchodilation, health status, and rescue medication use. A total of 467 patients completed the lead-in study and 291 patients consented to participate in the extension. At study end, the percentages of patients who reported a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) were similar for both treatments (200 Î¼g, 77.4%; 400 Î¼g, 73.7%). Incidence of anticholinergic TEAEs was low and similar for both treatments, with dry mouth reported in only 1 patient (400 Î¼g). Cardiac TEAEs were reported by a similarly low percentage of patients (<5% for any event in any group) with no apparent dose dependence. Improvements from baseline in lung function were greatest for patients who received continuous aclidinium treatment and those who were rerandomized from placebo to aclidinium 400 Î¼g; these improvements were generally sustained throughout the study. Health status and overall rescue medication use was improved from baseline for both treatments. The safety profile of twice-daily aclidinium and sustained improvements in lung function and health status throughout the 52-week extension study support its use as a long-term maintenance treatment for patients with COPD.

"We report the results of our experience using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to treat primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) from January 1992 until December 1994 in a multicentered co-operative study. A total of 132 patients (110 males and 22 females, aged 13-38 yrs, mean age 26 yrs) were treated by VATS to deal with the PSP that they presented with. A standard VATS technique was used. Apical bullae were always removed, and mechanical pleural abrasion was performed, leaving a pleural drainage tube. In two cases (1.5%), a switch to thoracotomy was necessary. In eight cases (6%), air leakage persisted for 5 days after surgery, which resolved with pleural drainage. There were eight postoperative relapses (6%), which were treated with pleural drainage (n = 4), VATS (n = 3) or axillar thoracotomy (n = 1). The average postoperative stay was 5.6 days (range 2-15 days). We conclude that video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is a viable alternative for the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. There is, however, a high relapse rate, and in a number of cases air leakage persists in the postoperative period.",

"We assessed a two-stage follow-up procedure for cardiac pacemakers, where in-clinic follow-ups were partly replaced by telemedical follow-ups. This was compared with the standard follow-up regime (in-clinic follow-up only). The new procedure required an electronic patient record, a telemedical follow-up unit for recording ECGs while the pacemaker was temporarily set to magnet mode, an ECG processing unit, and a reviewing and reporting unit. A total of 177 (86 female) patients were randomized to the control group and 182 (98 female) patients to the telemedicine group. In the telemedicine group, 234 telemedical follow-ups were performed. Out of these, 68 required an additional in-clinic follow-up, while 166 were sufficient for assessing the pacemakers' working status. During the study, there were 19 deaths in the telemedicine group and 20 in the control group. There was no significant difference between the two groups(Pâ=â0.40). The probability that an individual patient's pacemaker would not to be replaced over time was analysed in a similar way to the Kaplan-Meier survival function. Fewer pacemakers were replaced in the telemedicine group (14) than in the control group (18), but the difference was not significant (Pâ=â0.26). We conclude that alternating telemedical and in-clinic follow-ups brings no additional risks for patients. The follow-up procedure is feasible and interpretation of the pacemakers' magnet effect provides an easy-to-use, manufacturer-independent method of assessing the pacemakers' working status. This should reduce the patient load on pacemaker centres and decrease the overall costs of pacemaker therapy.",

In initial comparison (n = 208), children on NDRAA received 1-3 times amodiaquine per kilogram of body weight and 1-1.5 times of artesunate per kilogram of body weight compared with those receiving SDRAA. Parasite but not fever clearance was significantly faster in children who received NDRAA (19.4 Â± 8.4 hours vs. 24.6 Â± 15.5 hours, P = 0.003). Polymerase chain reaction-uncorrected cure rates on days 28-42 were also significantly higher in children who received NDRAA (P < 0.02 in all cases). Therapeutic responses in children younger than 5 years (n = 96) treated with NDRAA, FDAA, and AL were similar. Changes in hematocrit values and reported adverse events after commencing therapy were similar in those who received NDRAA and SDRAA. All drug regimens were well tolerated. NDRAA based on age or body weight range is simple, is therapeutically superior to SDRAA calculated according to body weight, and is as efficacious as AL in children younger than 5 years.",
"Biofeedback with or without combined autogenic training is known to be effective for the treatment of migraine. This study aimed to examine the effect of biofeedback treatment on headache activity, anxiety, and depression in Korean female patients with migraine headache. Patients were randomized into the treatment group (n=17) and monitoring group (n=15). Mood states including anxiety and depression, and psychophysiological variables such as mean skin temperature of the patients were compared with those of the normal controls (n=21). We found greater treatment response rate (defined as > or =50% reduction in headache index) in patients with biofeedback-assisted autogenic training than in monitoring group. The scores on the anxiety and depression scales in the patients receiving biofeedback-assisted autogenic training decreased after the biofeedback treatment. Moreover, the decrease in their anxiety levels was significantly related to the treatment outcome. This result suggests that the biofeedback-assisted autogenic training is effective for the treatment of migraine and its therapeutic effect is closely related to the improvement of the anxiety level.",
"The aim was to study the effectiveness of prescription medication containing 90% omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for 6 months on ventricular arrhythmias in patients with myocardial infarction less than a year ago.

"Between October 1993 and April 1995, a total of 77 neonates requiring mechanical ventilation were enrolled in this study and were randomly divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 31 premature infants (mean birthweight 1.36 +/- 0.29 kg) with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and seven neonates (mean birthweight 3.2 +/- 0.5 kg) with meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS).

"Routine scheduled angiographic follow-up (SAF) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been associated with a higher rate of target vessel revascularization (TVR). Its benefits are not known. SAF at 13 months after ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was planned in the first 1,800 successfully stented patients enrolled in the Harmonizing Outcomes with RevascularIZatiON and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial. We compared the outcomes of patients with and without SAF at 1 year (before SAF) and at 3 years (after SAF). There were 1,197 patients (66.5% of expected) with and 2,207 patients without SAF. Prior to SAF, the 1-year composite rate of death or myocardial infarction (MI) was not significantly different between the 2 groups (2.7% vs. 3.9%, respectively, P=0.06), although the rate of death was lower (0.1% vs. 2.2%, P<0.0001), nor were there differences in the 1-year rates of TVR, stent thrombosis or major adverse cardiac and cerebral events). At 3 years, death or MI rates were again similar between the groups (8.3% vs. 9.5%, P=0.22), but TVR was more common in the SAF group (17.0% vs. 8.6%, P<0.0001), due to an increase in TVR at time of SAF. In the SAF group, patients in whom TVR was performed before or after the 13-month SAF window had markedly higher 3-year rates of MI and stent thrombosis than patients in whom TVR was performed during SAF or not at all. In conclusion, SAF after primary PCI in STEMI is associated with doubling of the rate of revascularization without an improvement in death or MI, and therefore cannot be recommended.",
"Inflammation is thought to play a significant role in the underlying pathophysiology of migraine headaches which could be controlled by corticosteroids. The present study was conducted to determine and compare the pain relieving effect of dexamethasone versus morphine on patients with acute migraine headache. During this double blinded clinical trial study, 190 patients who met the International Headache Society definition of acute migraine headache were evaluated at emergency department of Tabriz Imam Reza Hospital. After giving informed consent, patients were randomly enrolled into two groups: Receiving either 8 mg dexamethasone (group A) or 0.1 mg kg(-1) morphine (group B) intravenously. Severity of the headache was determined using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scoring method at baseline (VAS-A), 10 min (VAS-B), 60 min (VAS-C) and 24 h (VAS-D) after intervention. The mean age of patients was 44.17 +/- 16.20 years, 61.57% male and 38.43% female. The mean of VAS-A and VAS-B scores was not statistically different between two groups (p = 0.236 and p = 0.481), but the mean of VAS-C and VAS-D scores in the group A were significantly lower than the group B (p = 0.017, p = 0.010). In long-term (1 h and 24 h after administration), dexamethasone reduces the severity of acute migrant headache more than morphine.",

"Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is common after cardiac surgery and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital stay. Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) has been applied recently for evaluation of LA function. The purpose of this study was to examine whether left atrial longitudinal strain measured by STE is a predictor for the development of POAF following mitral valve surgery for severe mitral regurgitation. We studied 53 patients undergoing mitral valve surgery in sinus rhythm at the time of surgery. Echocardiography with evaluation of LA strain by STE was performed. Detection of POAF was based on documentation of AF episodes by continuous telemetry throughout hospitalization. Patients who did not develop POAF were taken as group 1 and those who had POAF constituted group 2. The echocardiographic and clinical predictors of POAF were investigated. POAF occurred in 28.3% of subjects. Mean age, LAVi and BNP were found higher in group 2 while peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) (13.9 Â± 3.8% vs. 24.8 Â± 7.3%; P < 0.001), peak atrial contraction strain (PACS) (7.6 Â± 1.95% vs. 11.3 Â± 3.5%; P < 0.001) were significantly lower. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, PALS and LAVi were independent predictor of POAF development. LA longitudinal strain was found to predict POAF in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. It could be used to better identify patients at greater risk of developing POAF, and thus to guide in risk stratification and to take appropriate intensive prophylactic therapy.",

"Basal insulin (b-INS) is typically the add-on treatment of choice for patients with poor glycemic control (ie, glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] level â¥ 8.5%), but it is unclear whether b-INS is the best option. In this post hoc analysis, the efficacy and tolerability of exenatide once weekly (EQW) were compared with those of b-INS in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a baseline HbA1c level 8.5% who were undergoing treatment with metformin Â± a sulfonylurea. Data were pooled from two 26-week, randomized, controlled trials (EQW vs insulin glargine and EQW vs insulin detemir [EQW, N = 137; b-INS, N = 126]). Treatment with either EQW or b-INS for 26 weeks was associated with significant improvements in HbA1c level compared with baseline, although patients treated with EQW experienced a significantly greater decrease in HbA1c level than those treated with b-INS (least squares [LS] mean Â± SE: -2.0% Â± 0.08% vs -1.6% Â± 0.08%; P = 0.0008). Treatment with EQW was associated with a weight loss of 2.4 kg Â± 0.23 kg (LS mean Â± SE), whereas treatment with b-INS was associated with a weight gain of 2.0 kg Â± 0.24 kg (LS mean difference between groups, -4.4 kg Â± 0.33; P < 0.0001). Patients in the EQW group were significantly more likely to achieve the composite endpoint of an HbA1c level < 7.0%, no weight gain, and no hypoglycemic events (defined as a blood glucose level < 54 mg/dL requiring self-treatment or assistance to resolve) than patients in the b-INS group (33.6% vs 3.2%; P < 0.0001). The exposure-adjusted hypoglycemic event rates were 0.08 and 0.37 events per patient-year in the EQW and b-INS groups, respectively. Gastrointestinal adverse events occurred at a higher rate in patients who underwent EQW treatment than those who were treated with b-INS. These results show that EQW treatment was associated with significantly greater improvement in HbA1c level compared with b-INS treatment among patients with poor glycemic control, with the added benefits of weight loss (vs weight gain with b-INS therapy) and a lower incidence of hypoglycemic events. These results suggest that EQW is an alternative treatment to b-INS for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a baseline HbA1c level â¥ 8.5%.",

Using data from the Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of risk factors for venous thrombosis follow-up study, 4480 patients with VT, 2926 partner control participants, and 2638 random digit dialing (RDD) control participants were followed-up between 1999 and 2008. Incidence rates and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of CVD (defined as myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke) were calculated for patients vs controls. Measurable confounders (age, sex, body mass index, smoking, chronic disease, malignancy, genetic thrombophilia, and procoagulant markers) were adjusted for when comparing patients with RDD controls. Unmeasured lifestyle-related factors were also considered by comparing patients with their partners. During a median follow-up time of 5 years, 124 CVD events occurred. Incidence of CVD per 1000 person-years was 3.2 (95% CI, 2.5-4.0) in patients, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.5-3.0) in partners, and 1.6 (95% CI, 0.9-2.6) in RDD controls. Crude hazard ratio was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.2-3.8) in patients compared with RDD controls and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.0-2.3) in patients compared with partners. After adjustment for all confounders, these risks attenuated to 1.8 (95% CI, 0.8-4.2) and 1.3 (95% CI, 0.7-2.5) for patients compared with RDD control participants and partners, respectively. In conclusion, individuals with VT had an increased risk of CVD. This could be explained by common etiologic factors.",

Patients were studied from hospital admission to 18 days postinjury. Outcome was assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postinjury. The TPN group received a significantly higher cumulative mean intake of protein than the EN group (mean +/- standard error of the mean: 1.35 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.91 +/- 0.9 gm/kg/day; p = 0.004). Mean cumulative caloric balance was also significantly higher in the TPN than in the EN group (75.6% +/- 5.13% vs. 59% +/- 4.26%; p = 0.02). Nitrogen balance was significantly more negative in the EN group during the 1st week postinjury (p = 0.002). The incidence of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, septic shock, and infections was not significantly different between groups. Classic nutritional assessment parameters such as anergy screens, total lymphocyte counts, and albumin levels were not significantly different between groups. The 11 patients in the EN group who did not tolerate tube feedings for 1 week postinjury had a significantly higher incidence of septic shock (p = 0.008). The change over time in GCS scores between groups was significantly different, with the TPN group showing a mean four-point increase in GCS score compared with a three-point increase in the EN group (p = 0.02). At 3 months the TPN group had a significantly higher percentage of favorable outcomes (43.5% vs. 17.9%, respectively; p = 0.05). At 6 months, 43.5% of the TPN group had a favorable outcome while 32.1% of the EN group had a favorable outcome (p = 0.29). By 1 year, 47.8% of the TPN group and 32.1% of the EN group had a favorable outcome (p = 0.20). In conclusion, more calories and protein usually can be administered to acute brain injury patients via the TPN route than by EN feedings via nasogastric or nasoduodenal routes. Traditional parameters for nutritional assessment are not useful in studying the efficacy of nutritional support during the first 2 weeks after head injury. Neurological recovery from head injury occurs more rapidly in patients with better early nutritional support.",

Additionally, Olyset nets were evaluated for their biological activity using WHO cone bioassay test by susceptible colony of Anopheles stephensi (Beech strain) and then for insecticide residues by employing high performance thin layer chromatography. Malaria incidence was measured by passive and active case detection from all study population. In total 2115 adult anopheline mosquitoes were collected and identified using morphological characters. They comprised of seven species: Anopheles dthali (Liston), A. culicifacies (Giles), A. stephensi (Liston), A. superpictus (Grassi), A.fluviatilis (James), A. moghulensis (Christophers) and A. turkhudi (Liston). A. dthali, A. culicifacies and A. stephensi were most prevalent species in both areas. In the Olyset net study area, there was a significant reduction of 41.1%, 54.4%, 59.39% and 64.1% in the indoor-resting density of A. culicifacies, A. stephensi, A. dthali and A. superpictus, respectively, with an overall reduction of 39.3% in total mosquitoes in comparison with untreated net area. A significant reduction was also observed in human blood index of vector species in the Olyset net villages. Bioefficacy test results of Olyset nets showed that the median knockdown time was 1.48 and 3.25min, while the average mortality rate was 100% and 72.3%Â±7.07 in baseline and after 1 year of intervention, respectively. The average permethrin content reached to 68.31% (683.1mg/m(2)) of the initial insecticide dose of 937Â±21.69mg/m(2) (nearly 1000mg/m(2)) at the end of intervention. Malaria incidence was reduced by 96.6% and 64.8% in the village with Olyset nets and in the villages with untreated nets, respectively. During intervention period, there was a reduction of 93.2% in malaria incidence in Olyset net area as compared to the untreated area. This study indicated that Olyset nets have a major impact on malaria vectors and disease burden; therefore it could be recommended as an effective personal protection tool for malaria control in malarious areas.",

"The study was set up to determine the clinical value of dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography-computed tomography ([(18)F]DOPA PET-CT) in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Eighty-two patients with suspected/known NET were imaged with PET(-CT) using [(18)F]DOPA. Patients were divided into two groups: primary diagnosis/staging and restaging of disease. All patients without previous diagnosis of NET had biochemical proof of disease. The diagnostic accuracy of PET was assessed by comparing the histopathology and clinical follow-up. The overall accuracy of [(18)F]DOPA PET was 90%. In patients having PET for primary diagnosis/staging (n=32), the accuracy of PET was 88%, and for restaging 92% (n=61). The mean s.d. sizes of primary and metastatic lesions detected by PET were 26+/-11 and 16+/-9 mm respectively. In organ-region-specific analysis, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% in the primary diagnosis of pheochromocytoma (n=16) and metastases were found in all cases with recurrent disease (n=5). The accuracy for NET of gastrointestinal tract was 92% in restaging (n=24). For the NETs located in the head-neck-thoracic region (n=19), the overall accuracy of PET was 89% including 12 cases of recurrent medullary thyroid cancer with a sensitivity of 90%. In analysis of patients with biochemical proof of disease combined with negative conventional imaging methods, PET had positive and negative predictive value of 92% and 95% respectively. [(18)F]DOPA PET-CT provided important additional information in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma and restaging of known NET. Both in primary diagnosis and in patients with formerly known NET and increasing tumor markers, [(18)F]DOPA PET-CT is a sensitive first-line imaging method.",

"Our aim was to analyze any changes during diastole in patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), after pacemaker stimulation from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and right ventricular apex (RVA) lead position. This was a prospective, randomized, follow up study, which lasted for 12 months. Our research included 132 consecutive patients who were implanted with a permanent antibradycardiac pacemaker. Regarding the right ventricle lead position the patients were divided into two groups: The RVOT group--71 patients, with right ventricle outflow tract lead position and the RVA group--61 patients, with right ventricle apex lead position. We measured LVEF and diastolic parameters: peak filling ratio and time to peak filling ratio obtained by radionuclide ventriculography (RNV). The LVEF and various diastolic parameters and left atrial diameter were obtained by echocardiography. Based on the values of deceleration time of early diastolic filling (DTE), and other diastolic parameters like left atrial diameter, all the patients were classified into three degrees of diastolic dysfunction. Our results showed that there was no group difference in distribution of gender, age, body mass index (BMI), VVI to DDD pacemakers implantation ratio, RNV parameters (LVEF, peak filling rate (PFR), time to PFR (TPFR)) and echocardiography parameters: LVEF and parameters of diastolic dysfunction. After 12 months of pacemaker stimulation, LVEF by RNV remained the same in the RVOT group 51.31Â±15.80% (P=0.75), and also in the RVA group 53.83Â±6.57%, (P=0.19). In the RVOT group the PFR was highly lower and this finding was significant (P=0.01), while TPFR was also significantly lower (P=0.03). By dividing the patients according to the degree of diastolic dysfunction we found that most patients in both groups at enrollment had a second degree diastolic dysfunction. In both groups diastolic dysfunction increased, the number of patients with third degree diastolic dysfunction increased, and the number of patients with second degree diastolic dysfunction decreased, however, the worsening of diastolic function was significant only in the RVOT group. In conclusion, pacemaker stimulation from RVOT, but not in RVA, leads to progression of diastolic dysfunction in patients with preserved LVEF. This negative effect of pacemaker stimulation from RVOT on diastolic parameters was confirmed by two independent methods, RNV and echocardiography.",

"Vernakalant hydrochloride injection (RSD1235) is a relatively atrial-selective antiarrhythmic agent that converts atrial fibrillation rapidly to sinus rhythm. The pharmacokinetics of vernakalant were explored in healthy volunteers and in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter in 4 clinical studies. Key pharmacokinetic parameters analyzed were the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve. Vernakalant exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 0.1 mg/kg to 5.0 mg/kg in healthy subjects, and generally showed dose proportionality in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who received 1 or 2 vernakalant infusions. Vernakalant was metabolized rapidly via 4-O-demethylation by cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 to its major metabolite RSD1385, which then circulated predominantly as an inactive glucuronide conjugate. In most patients, the maximum plasma concentration of RSD1385 glucuronide exceeded that of vernakalant. Unconjugated RSD1385 was found at low levels in all patients demonstrating either a cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 "extensive metabolizer" or "poor metabolizer" phenotype or genotype; however, CYP2D6 poor metabolizers had even lower levels of unconjugated RSD1385. The impact of CYP2D6 metabolizer status on vernakalant exposure was explored in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who received a therapeutic regimen (3 mg/kg initially via 10-minute intravenous infusion followed by a second 2 mg/kg 10-minute infusion if atrial fibrillation persisted after a 15-minute observation period). In the subset that received 2 vernakalant infusions, there was little difference in vernakalant maximum plasma concentration or area under the plasma concentration-time curve from the start of the first infusion to 90 minutes between CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers or between those who did or did not receive concomitant CYP2D6-inhibitor medications. Gender, age, and renal function did not have a clinically significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of vernakalant. These results suggest that an assessment of CYP2D6 expression may not be needed when vernakalant is administered acutely and intravenously to patients with atrial fibrillation.",

"In tuberculosis (TB), the production of nitric oxide (NO) is confirmed but its importance in host defense is debated. Our aim was to investigate whether a food supplement rich in arginine could enhance clinical improvement in TB patients by increased NO production. Smear positive TB patients from Gondar, Ethiopia (n = 180) were randomized to a food supplementation rich in arginine (peanuts, equivalent to 1 g of arginine/day) or with a low arginine content (wheat crackers, locally called daboqolo) during four weeks. The primary outcome was cure rate according to the WHO classification and secondary outcomes were sputum smear conversion, weight gain, sedimentation rate, reduction of cough and chest X-ray improvement as well as levels of NO in urine (uNO) or exhaled air (eNO) at two months. There was no effect of the intervention on the primary outcome (OR 1.44, 95% CI: 0.69-3.0, p = 0.39) or secondary outcomes. In the subgroup analysis according to HIV status, peanut supplemented HIV+/TB patients showed increased cure rate (83.8% (31/37) vs 53.1% (17/32), p < 0.01). A low baseline eNO (<10 ppb) in HIV+/TB patients was associated with a decreased cure rate. We conclude that nutritional supplementation with a food supplement rich in arginine did not have any overall clinical effect. In the subgroup of HIV positive TB patients, it significantly increased the cure rate and as an additional finding in this subgroup, low initial levels of NO in exhaled air were associated with a poor clinical outcome but this needs to be confirmed in further studies.",
"Recent clinical evidence and animal experiments support the belief that statins have beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes and prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated whether the use of statins reduces the mortality, morbidity, and recurrence rate of AF in patients with paroxysmal AF. A post hoc analysis of the Japanese Rhythm Management Trial for Atrial Fibrillation (J-RHYTHM) study was conducted.Of the 823 patients with paroxysmal AF in the J-RHYTHM study, 101 (12.3%) were receiving a statin at baseline. Patients taking statins were older and more likely to have hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and ischemic stroke compared to patients not taking statins. During a mean follow-up period of 19.3 months, 40 patients (5.5%) reached the primary endpoint (a composite of all-cause death, stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, and hospitalization for heart failure) and 140 patients (19.4%) experienced a recurrence of AF. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis revealed statin use was not associated with improved mortality and morbidity (hazard ratio [HR] 0.409, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.113-1.482), or a decreased risk of AF recurrence (HR 0.662, 95% CI 0.299-1.466).This analysis provides evidence that statin use did not affect clinical outcomes in patients with paroxysmal AF and emphasizes the need for randomized clinical trials defining more clearly the role of statins in treating AF.",

"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP38) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide are structurally and functionally closely related but show differences in migraine-inducing properties. Mechanisms responsible for the difference in migraine induction are unknown. Here, for the first time, we present a head-to-head comparison study of the immediate and long-lasting observations of the migraine-inducing, arterial, physiological and biochemical responses comparing PACAP38 and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. In a double-blind crossover study 24 female migraine patients without aura were randomly allocated to intravenous infusion of PACAP38 (10 pmol/kg/min) or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (8 pmol/kg/min) over 20 min. We recorded incidence of migraine during and after infusion (0-24 h). Magnetic resonance angiography of selected extra- and intracranial arteries, blood samples (plasma PACAP38 and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and serum tryptase), and vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory frequency, and end-tidal pressure of CO2) was recorded before and up to 5 h after infusion. Twenty-two patients [mean age 24 years (range 19-36)] completed the study on both days. Sixteen patients (73%) reported migraine-like attacks after PACAP38 and four after vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (18%) infusion (P = 0.002). Three of four patients, who reported migraine-like attacks after vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, also reported attacks after PACAP38. Both peptides induced marked dilatation of the extracranial (P < 0.05), but not intracranial arteries (P > 0.05). PACAP38-induced vasodilatation was longer lasting (>2 h), whereas vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-induced dilatation was normalized after 2 h. We recorded elevated plasma PACAP38 at 1 h after the start of PACAP38 infusion only in those patients who later reported migraine attacks. Blood levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and tryptase were unchanged after PACAP38 infusion. In conclusion, PACAP38-induced migraine was associated with sustained dilatation of extracranial arteries and elevated plasma PACAP38 before onset of migraine-like attacks. PACAP38 has a much higher affinity for the PAC1 receptor and we therefore suggest that migraine induction by PACAP38 may be because of activation of the PAC1 receptor, which may be a future anti-migraine drug target.",
"Seventy-one patients with recurrent migraine headaches, aged 17-62, from one neurological practice, completed a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) procedure. All QEEG results indicated an excess of high-frequency beta activity (21-30 Hz) in 1-4 cortical areas. Forty-six of the 71 patients selected neurofeedback training while the remaining 25 chose to continue on drug therapy. Neurofeedback protocols consisted of reducing 21-30 Hz activity and increasing 10 Hz activity (5 sessions for each affected site). All the patients were classified as migraine without aura. For the neurofeedback group the majority (54%) experienced complete cessation of their migraines, and many others (39%) experienced a reduction in migraine frequency of greater than 50%. Four percent experienced a decrease in headache frequency of < 50%. Only one patient did not experience a reduction in headache frequency. The control group of subjects who chose to continue drug therapy as opposed to neurofeedback experienced no change in headache frequency (68%), a reduction of less than 50% (20%), or a reduction greater than 50% (8%). QEEG-guided neurofeedback appears to be dramatically effective in abolishing or significantly reducing headache frequency in patients with recurrent migraine.",
"Uncontrolled studies have suggested that increasing the dose of ziprasidone above the standard maximum daily dose of 160 mg may be more effective for some patients with schizophrenia. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an 8-week, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose escalation trial comparing ziprasidone 160 versus 320 mg/d in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who remained symptomatic despite treatment with ziprasidone 160 mg/d for at least 3 weeks. Of 75 randomized patients, 42 completed the study. Serum ziprasidone concentrations increased significantly in the high-dose group compared with the standard-dose group at week 4 but did not differ between groups at week 8. Both treatment groups exhibited significant symptomatic improvement. Response did not differ between treatment groups; however, in the high-dose group, higher ziprasidone serum concentrations were associated with better response at a trend level. Higher ziprasidone concentrations were also associated with reductions in diastolic blood pressure and, at a trend level, with more prominent negative symptoms and greater QTc prolongation. In summary, increasing the ziprasidone dose to 320 mg/d did not produce a sustained elevation in serum concentrations or symptomatic improvement compared with a standard ziprasidone dose of 160 mg/d.",
"The sponsor and the steering committee terminated the trial on the recommendation of the independent data and safety monitoring committee; the median follow-up was 9 months. A total of 69 of 1088 patients (6%) randomly assigned to bardoxolone methyl and 69 of 1097 (6%) randomly assigned to placebo had a primary composite outcome (hazard ratio in the bardoxolone methyl group vs. the placebo group, 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.37; P=0.92). In the bardoxolone methyl group, ESRD developed in 43 patients, and 27 patients died from cardiovascular causes; in the placebo group, ESRD developed in 51 patients, and 19 patients died from cardiovascular causes. A total of 96 patients in the bardoxolone methyl group were hospitalized for heart failure or died from heart failure, as compared with 55 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.32 to 2.55; P<0.001).

The cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint at 24 months was 16.7% in the short DAPT regimen group compared with 7.3% in the long DAPT regimen group (pÂ = 0.034). This is principally due to a lower occurrence of death and MI in the long DAPT regimen group as compared to the short DAPT regimen group (6.5%Â vs.Â 15.5%; pÂ = 0.03).

"Current recommendations on the management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent (PCI-S) essentially derive from small, single-center, retrospective datasets. To obtain larger and better quality data, we carried out the prospective, multicenter Atrial Fibrillation undergoing Coronary Artery Stenting (AFCAS) study. Therefore, consecutive patients with history of or ongoing AF undergoing PCI-S were enrolled, and occurrence of adverse ischemic and bleeding events recorded during 12 months follow-up. In this article, we report the in-hospital observations. Out of the 963 patients, in the majority of cases (49.1%) AF was permanent. The associated risk of stroke, as defined by a CHADS2 -score â¥2, was in 70% of patients moderate to high. Upon enrollment in the registry, 69.3% of patients were on VKA therapy. Overall occurrence of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events was 4.5% (cardiovascular death 1.9%, urgent revascularization in 1.5%, and stroke/arterial thromboembolism in 0.6%). Bleeding complications occurred in 7.1% of patients, being severe in 2.5%. In a logistic regression analysis, no risk factor was independently associated with bleeding events, whereas Clopidogrel treatment decreased and female gender/treatment with gpIIb/IIIa-antagonists, respectively increased the risk for the combined ischemic endpoint. The majority of AF patients undergoing PCI-S are at high stroke risk, and therefore VKA treatment should not be withdrawn and combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet treatment is warranted. Current management appears largely in accordance with current recommendations, whereby accounting for the limited occurrence of in-hospital adverse ischemic and bleeding events.",

"This study was designed to confirm the appropriateness of the dose setting for a Japanese phase III study of rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), which had been based on model simulation employing phase II study data. The previously developed mixed-effects pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model, which consisted of an oral one-compartment model parameterized in terms of clearance, volume and a first-order absorption rate, was rebuilt and optimized using the data for 597 subjects from the Japanese phase III study, J-ROCKET AF. A mixed-effects modeling technique in NONMEM was used to quantify both unexplained inter-individual variability and inter-occasion variability, which are random effect parameters. The final PK and PK-PD models were evaluated to identify influential covariates. The empirical Bayes estimates of AUC and C(max) from the final PK model were consistent with the simulated results from the Japanese phase II study. There was no clear relationship between individual estimated exposures and safety-related events, and the estimated exposure levels were consistent with the global phase III data. Therefore, it was concluded that the dose selected for the phase III study with Japanese NVAF patients by means of model simulation employing phase II study data had been appropriate from the PK-PD perspective.",

"Phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are highly heterogeneous tumours with variable catecholamine biochemical phenotypes and diverse hereditary backgrounds. This analysis of 18 catecholamine-related plasma and urinary biomarkers in 365 patients with PPGLs and 846 subjects without PPGLs examined how catecholamine metabolomic profiles are impacted by hereditary background and relate to variable hormone secretion. Catecholamine secretion was assessed in a subgroup of 156 patients from whom tumour tissue was available for measurements of catecholamine contents. Among all analytes, the free catecholamine O-methylated metabolites measured in plasma showed the largest tumour-related increases relative to the reference group. Patients with tumours due to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) showed similar catecholamine metabolite and secretory profiles to patients with adrenaline-producing tumours and no evident hereditary background. Tumours from these three patient groups contained higher contents of catecholamines, but secreted the hormones at lower rates than tumours that did not contain appreciable adrenaline, the latter including PPGLs due to von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) gene mutations. Large increases of plasma dopamine and its metabolites additionally characterised patients with PPGLs due to the latter mutations, whereas patients with NF1 were characterised by large increases in plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, the deaminated metabolites of noradrenaline and dopamine. This analysis establishes the utility of comprehensive catecholamine metabolite profiling for characterising the distinct and highly diverse catecholamine metabolomic and secretory phenotypes among different groups of patients with PPGLs. The data further suggest developmental origins of PPGLs from different populations of chromaffin cell progenitors.",

"Primary headaches, migraine and tension-type headaches are some of the most frequent conditions in young age. Even before pharmacological treatment, it is mainly useful in these patients to adopt an appropriate lifestyle, with regular sleep, meals, computer and TV, sport, and avoiding triggers. Any specific and effective pharmacological treatment for migraine and tension-type headache is never lacking in side effects. Gingkolide B, an herbal constituent extract from Ginko biloba tree leaves, is a natural anti platelet activating factor (PAF). PAF is a potent pro inflammatory and nociceptive agent released during the inflammation process. Therefore, Gingkolide B can be considered a promising non pharmacological tool for treatment of migraine with and without aura. In an earlier clinical report, we described our initial attempts to assess the clinical utility of Gingkolide B in a small group of young migraine patients. A small sample of 30 young patients suffering from migraine without aura entered the open-label prospective trial. Migraine without aura was diagnosed according to International Headache Society (IHS) criteria. The treatment was well tolerated and the compliance was good. Despite the uncontrolled open-label design of this study and the small sample of patients, these data show that Gingkolide B seems to be effective as preventive treatment in reducing migraine attack frequency and in attenuating the use of symptomatic medication in our small series of children with primary headache.",

"This chapter provides a set of indicators related to Renal Transplantation access in France. It describes patient outcomes and reports on cumulative incidence rates of wait-listing and renal transplantation according to main patient of characteristics and regions. The REIN registry integrates kidney transplant and dialysis data. It provides a comprehensive view on waiting list and renal transplantation access to the patients, nephrologists, and national or regional health authorities. Access to the waiting list is evaluated on a cohort of 51,845 new patients who started dialysis between 2002 and 2011 in 25 regions. The probability of first wait-listing was of 3.7% at the start of dialysis (pre-emptive registrations), 15% at 12, 22% at 36 and 24% to 60 months. The probability of being registered was strongly related to age, diabetes and region. Patient older than 60 had a very poor access to the waiting list, whatever their diabetes status was. Probability of first wait-listing was much lower (36.5% at 60 months) in type 2 diabetic-40 to 59 years old patients. Among 13,653 patients less than 60 years old, the probability of being registered was 11% at the start of dialysis, 43% to 12 months, 62% to 36 months and 66% to 60 months (median dialysis duration: 16 months). Seventeen regions with up to 5 years follow-up show an increase of 8 to 15% in pre-emptive registrations between 2007 and 2001, without change at 1 year. Access to kidney transplant is evaluated on a cohort of 53,301 new patients who started a renal replacement therapy (dialysis or pre-emptive renal transplant) between 2002 and 2011 in 25 regions. The probability of first kidney transplant was of 7% at 12, 17% at 36 and 21% at 60 months. 8,633 patients (16,2%) had received a first renal transplant within 14.7 month median time; 1,455 (2.7%) had received a pre-emptive graft [male: 58%, median age: 48.7y]. Among the 14,770 new patients less than 60 years old, the probability of being transplanted was of 21% at 12, 46% at 36 and 58% at 60 months (median dialysis duration: 42 months). When pre-emptive graft were excluded, the probability of being transplanted was of 5% at 12, 15% to 36 and 19% to 60 months Insofar as kidney transplant is regarded as the most efficient treatment, access to the waiting list and renal transplant are sensitive issues.",
"This is the first study of tecarfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation.

"We compared the performance of four rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for imported malaria, and particularly Plasmodium falciparum infection, using thick and thin blood smears as the gold standard. All the tests are designed to detect at least one protein specific to P. falciparum (Plasmodium histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) or Plasmodium LDH (PfLDH)) and one pan-Plasmodium protein (aldolase or Plasmodium LDH (pLDH)). 1,311 consecutive patients presenting to 9 French hospitals with suspected malaria were included in this prospective study between April 2006 and September 2008. Blood smears revealed malaria parasites in 374 cases (29%). For the diagnosis of P. falciparum infection, the three tests detecting PfHRP2 showed high and similar sensitivity (96%), positive predictive value (PPV) (90%) and negative predictive value (NPV) (98%). The PfLDH test showed lower sensitivity (83%) and NPV (80%), despite good PPV (98%). For the diagnosis of non-falciparum species, the PPV and NPV of tests targeting pLDH or aldolase were 94-99% and 52-64%, respectively. PfHRP2-based RDTs are thus an acceptable alternative to routine microscopy for diagnosing P. falciparum malaria. However, as malaria may be misdiagnosed with RDTs, all negative results must be confirmed by the reference diagnostic method when clinical, biological or other factors are highly suggestive of malaria.",

"The global ROCKET AF phase III trial evaluated rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (o.d.) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF). Based on rivaroxaban pharmacokinetics in Japanese subjects and lower anticoagulation preferences in Japan, particularly in elderly patients, the optimal dose regimen for Japanese AF patients was considered. The aim of this analysis was dose selection for Japanese patients from a pharmacokinetic aspect by comparison of simulated exposure in Japanese patients with those in Caucasian patients. As a result of population pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics analyses, a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption and direct link pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models optimally described the plasma concentration and pharmacodynamic models (Factor Xa activity, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and HepTest), which were also consistent with previous works. Steady-state simulations indicated 15 mg rivaroxaban o.d. doses in Japanese patients with AF would yield exposures comparable to the 20 mg o.d. dose in Caucasian patients with AF. In conclusion, in the context of the lower anticoagulation targets in Japanese practice, the population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling supports 15 mg o.d. as the principal rivaroxaban dose in J-ROCKET AF.",

"Advances in antithrombotic therapy for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) enhance the risk of bleeding. Therefore, the incidence, determinants, and prognostic implications of in-hospital major bleeding after primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI were investigated. In 963 consecutive patients, the incidence of bleeding was evaluated according to commonly used classifications including Can Rapid risk stratification of Unstable angina patients Suppress Adverse outcomes with Early implementation of the ACC/AHA guidelines, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction, Global Use of Strategies To Open coronary arteries, and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium. Multivariate regression analyses investigated determinants of bleeding and the relation between bleeding and 1-year all-cause mortality. Large variability in incidence existed depending on classification (1.3% to 21%). Female gender, heart rate, creatinine, multivessel disease, cardiogenic shock, and procedural failure were independently associated with bleeding. One-year mortality reached 10.2% in bleeders versus 2.0% in nonbleeders (p <0.001). Bleeding was independently associated with an increased risk of 1-year mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 2.41, p <0.017). Assessment of individual classifications confirmed the increased risk of mortality for Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (HR 2.27, p = 0.048), but not for Can Rapid risk stratification of Unstable angina patients Suppress Adverse outcomes with Early implementation of the ACC/AHA guidelines, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction, and Global Use of Strategies To Open coronary arteries bleeding. Thrombotic events occurred more frequently in bleeders (5.8% vs 1.5%, p <0.001); however, bleeding remained independently related to mortality with a negligible reduction in HR (2.25, p = 0.028) after adjustment. In conclusion, in-hospital major bleeding was frequently observed after STEMI, but a widespread variation in incidence existed depending on the applied definition. Patient and procedural characteristics were related to bleeding, allowing identification of high-risk patients. In-hospital major bleeding was independently associated with 1-year all-cause mortality; however, not all bleeding classifications proved equally relevant to prognosis. The relation between bleeding and mortality was shown not to be driven by the higher rate of thrombotic events among bleeders.",

"Anti-inflammatory and pain therapies have been associated with blood pressure (BP) destabilization. Hence, the effects on BP of sumatriptan/naproxen sodium in fixed-dose combination, sumatriptan 85 mg, and naproxen sodium 500 mg administered intermittently for the acute treatment of migraine attacks were assessed. Patients with migraine with or without aura and no history of hypertension were randomized to sumatriptan/naproxen sodium (n=135), sumatriptan (n=136), or naproxen sodium (n=136) to treat migraine attacks for 6 months in a double-blind, parallel-group trial. Following a treated migraine attack, patients performed 2 consecutive days of self-measured BPs beginning â¥24 hours after the last dose of study medication and transmitted them by a transtelephonic modem. The primary end point was the change from baseline in self-measured BP at 6 months. Changes in self-measured BP from baseline to 6 months for sumatriptan/naproxen sodium were -2.1/-1.5 mm Hg (95% confidence intervals, -3.4 to -0.8 for systolic and -2.6 to -0.3 for diastolic). Mean changes from baseline in self-measured BP did not differ among the 3 treatment groups. Additional categorical analyses did not show increases from baseline with sumatriptan/naproxen sodium relative to either of the monotherapy groups. Intermittent acute migraine treatment with sumatriptan/naproxen sodium for up to 6 months was associated with clinically insignificant decreases in self-measured BP that were similar to those with sumatriptan or naproxen alone in normotensive patients with migraine.",

"Although hypertension contributes significantly to worsen cardiovascular risk, blood pressure increment in subjects with heart failure is paradoxically associated with lower risk. The objective was to determine whether pulse pressure and pulse wave velocity (PWV) remain prognostic markers, independent of treatment in heart failure with reduced left ventricular function. The investigation involved 6632 patients of the Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival Study. All subjects had acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular ejection fraction <40% and signs/symptoms of heart failure. Carotid-femoral PWV was measured in a subpopulation of 306 subjects. In the overall population, baseline mean arterial pressure <90 mm Hg was associated with higher all-cause death (hazard ratio, 1.14 [95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.30]; P<0.05), whereas higher left ventricular ejection fraction or pulse pressure was associated with lower rates of all-cause death, cardiovascular death/hospitalization, and cardiovascular death. In the subpopulation, increased baseline PWV was associated with worse outcomes (all-cause death: 1.16 [1.03-1.30]; P<0.05 and cardiovascular deaths: 1.16 [1.03-1.31]; P<0.05), independent of age and left ventricular ejection fraction. Using multiple regression analysis, systolic blood pressure and age were the main independent factors positively associated with pulse pressure or PWV, both in the entire population or in the PWV substudy. In heart failure and low ejection fraction, our results suggest that pulse pressure, being negatively associated with outcome, is more dependent on left ventricular function and thereby no longer a marker of aortic elasticity. In contrast, increased aortic stiffness, assessed by PWV, contributes significantly to cardiovascular death.",

"Ranolazine, an antianginal agent with antiarrhythmic properties, prevents atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with acute coronary syndrome. In experimental models, the combination of ranolazine and amiodarone has marked synergistic effects that potently suppress AF. Currently, the clinical effect of the ranolazine-amiodarone combination for the conversion of AF is unknown. This prospective randomized pilot study compared the safety and efficacy of ranolazine plus amiodarone versus amiodarone alone for the conversion of recent-onset AF. We enrolled 51 consecutive patients with AF (<48-hour duration) eligible for pharmacologic cardioversion. Patients (33 men, 63 Â± 8 years of age) were randomized to intravenous amiodarone for 24 hours (group A, n = 26) or to intravenous amiodarone plus oral ranolazine 1,500 mg at time of randomization (group A + R, n = 25). The 2 groups were well balanced with respect to clinical characteristics and left atrial diameter. Conversion within 24 hours (primary end point) was achieved in 22 patients (88%) in group A + R versus 17 patients (65%) in group A (p = 0.056). Time to conversion was shorter in group A + R than in group A (9.8 Â± 4.1 vs 14.6 Â± 5.3 hours, p = 0.002). According to Cox regression analysis, left atrial diameter and A + R treatment were the only independent predictors of time to conversion (hazard ratio 5.35, 95% confidence interval 2.37 to 12.11, p <0.001; hazard ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.88, p <0.001, respectively). There were no proarrhythmic events in either group. In conclusion, addition of ranolazine to standard amiodarone therapy is equally safe and appears to be more effective compared to amiodarone alone for conversion of recent-onset AF.",

"The authors investigated the effectiveness of the blood patch technique in reducing the pneumothorax and chest tube insertion rates after transthoracic needle lung biopsy. Biopsy of 100 pulmonary nodules was performed with a coaxial system. In this prospective, randomized study, patients either received a blood patch (group A, n = 46) or did not (group B, n = 47). Seven procedures were excluded: five for technical reasons and two because of lack of follow-up information. Comparison of the two groups by means of X2 analysis and the Student t test revealed no difference in the mean age, gender, smoking history, proportion of heavy smokers, nodule size, presence of cavitation, or number of needle passes. The pneumothorax rate was 24% (11 of 46 patients) in group A and 30% (14 of 47 patients) in group B. The chest tube insertion rate was 2.2% (one patient) in group A and 2.1% (one patient) in group B. The difference between the groups in either rate was not significant (P greater than .5). The blood patch technique did not lower the rate of pneumothorax or chest tube insertion.",

"Combination therapy with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) decreases proteinuria; however, its safety and effect on the progression of kidney disease are uncertain. Methods We provided losartan (at a dose of 100 mg per day) to patients with type 2 diabetes, a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 300, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30.0 to 89.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area and then randomly assigned them to receive lisinopril (at a dose of 10 to 40 mg per day) or placebo. The primary end point was the first occurrence of a change in the estimated GFR (a decline of â¥ 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) if the initial estimated GFR was â¥ 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) or a decline of â¥ 50% if the initial estimated GFR was <60 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2)), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or death. The secondary renal end point was the first occurrence of a decline in the estimated GFR or ESRD. Safety outcomes included mortality, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. Results The study was stopped early owing to safety concerns. Among 1448 randomly assigned patients with a median follow-up of 2.2 years, there were 152 primary end-point events in the monotherapy group and 132 in the combination-therapy group (hazard ratio with combination therapy, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.12; P=0.30). A trend toward a benefit from combination therapy with respect to the secondary end point (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.05; P=0.10) decreased with time (P=0.02 for nonproportionality). There was no benefit with respect to mortality (hazard ratio for death, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.49; P=0.75) or cardiovascular events. Combination therapy increased the risk of hyperkalemia (6.3 events per 100 person-years, vs. 2.6 events per 100 person-years with monotherapy; P<0.001) and acute kidney injury (12.2 vs. 6.7 events per 100 person-years, P<0.001). Conclusions Combination therapy with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB was associated with an increased risk of adverse events among patients with diabetic nephropathy.

"Migraine attacks are common in the perimenstrual period (menstrually-related migraine, MRM) and can be particularly exacerbated by the cyclic suspension of oral contraceptives (oral contraceptive-induced menstrual migraine, OCMM). This cross-over, randomised study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of rectal (25âmg) and oral (50âmg) sumatriptan in the treatment of 232 menstrual migraine attacks (135 MRM and 97 OCMM). Two hours after suppository administration, 72% of patients in the MRM group achieved pain relief and 24% were pain free; after tablet administration, the percentages were 66% and 27%, respectively. In the OCMM group 55% of patients improved at 2âh with suppositories and 46% with tablets, 27% of patients were pain-free after suppositories and 18% after tablets. Fifty percent of patients given suppositories were pain-free at 4âh post-treatment and 47% of those given tablets. Sumatriptan also effectively alleviated symptoms associated with migraine, such as nausea, vomiting and photo/phonophobia.

"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) carries significant risks for coronary heart disease (CHD). We examined the potential US population impact of single and composite risk factor control. Among US adults with diagnosed T2DM agedâ¥30 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007 to 2012, we assessed CHD events preventable using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study CHD risk engine. We examined in all those not at goal the impact of statistical control of smoking, glycated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, according to the predefined criteria setting risk factors at different levels of control representing (1) "All to Goal," (2) at "Nominal Control," or (3) at "Aggressive Control." Preventable CHD events represented the difference between the number of events estimated from the control of these risk factors versus current levels of the risk factors. Of 606 men (representing 6.2 million) and 603 women (6.3 million) with DM and no previous CHD, 1.3 million men and 0.7 million women would develop a CHD event within 10 years if left uncontrolled. Controlling all risk factors to goal was projected to prevent 35% and 45% of CHD events in men and women, respectively. Nominal risk factor control was projected to prevent 36% and 38% and aggressive control 51% and 61% of CHD events, respectively. In conclusion, a significant proportion of CHD events in adults with T2DM could be prevented from composite control of risk factors often not at goal.",

"Elderly patients with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy are more likely to experience falls. However, the information available on how such falls can be prevented is scarce. We investigated the effects of whole-body vibration (WBV) combined with a balance exercise program on balance, muscle strength, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in elderly patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Fifty-five elderly patients with diabetic neuropathy were randomly assigned to WBV with balance exercise group, balance exercise (BE) group, and control group. The WBV and BE groups performed the balance exercise program for 60 min per day, 2 times per week, for 6 weeks. Further, the WBV group performed WBV training (up to 3 Ã 3 min, 3 times per week, for 6 weeks). The control group did not participate in any training. The main outcome measures were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks of training; namely, we assessed the postural sway and one leg stance (OLS) for static balance; Berg balance scale (BBS), timed up-and-go (TUG) test, and functional reach test (FRT) for dynamic balance; five-times-sit-to-stand (FTSTS) test for muscle strength; and HbA1c for predicting the progression of diabetes. Significant improvements were noted in the static balance, dynamic balance, muscle strength, and HbA1c in the WBV group, compared to the BE and control groups (P < 0.05). Thus, in combination with the balance exercise program, the short-term WBV therapy is beneficial in improving balance, muscle strength and HbA1c, in elderly patients with diabetic neuropathy who are at high risk for suffering falls.",

"We investigated the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of efavirenz in 307 patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis and included in the Cambodian Early vs Late Initiation of Antiretrovirals trial (CAMELIA) in Cambodia. Efavirenz (600 mg/d) and stavudine plus lamivudine were administered in addition to standard antituberculosis treatment, including rifampicin and isoniazid. Blood samples were obtained a mean of 14 hours after efavirenz intake at weeks 2 and 6 after initiation of efavirenz and weeks 22 (efavirenz plus antituberculosis drugs) and 50 (efavirenz alone) after initiation of antituberculosis treatment. Ten patients participated in an extensive pharmacokinetic study after week 50. CYP2B6 G516T and C485-18T polymorphisms were the most significant covariates, with weight showing a significant minor effect. Change in efavirenz apparent clearance in patients taking both efavirenz and antituberculosis treatment was highly dependent on NAT2 polymorphism, as a possible surrogate of isoniazid exposure. Patients carrying the CYP2B6 516 TT genotype and slow-acetylation NAT2 phenotype had the lowest efavirenz apparent clearance. These data suggest that the inducing effect of rifampicin is counterbalanced by a concentration-dependant inhibitory effect of isoniazid on efavirenz clearance.",

The median age was 49 years (range 15-85), M:F ratio 1.6:1, and the median follow-up was 7.9 years. (2.5-34.6). The primary tumor size was < 1 cm in 10%, 1-4 cm in 53%, and > 4 cm in 37%. Multifocality was noted in 32%, and 23% had metastasis at presentation. Eight patients presented with inoperable tumors, 40% had gross, and 37% microscopic residual disease postthyroidectomy. Extraglandular extension was present in 56%, and 74% had pathologically involved lymph nodes. Treatment was by total or near total thyroidectomy in 41 patients; 37 had a lymph node dissection. Forty-six patients were irradiated, the dose of radiation ranging from 20 to 75.5 Gy; median was 40 Gy, treatment time median was 28 days and the median number of fractions was 20. The overall cause specific survival (CSS) was 70% and 57% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. In a univariate analysis, the following factors predicted for lower CSS: age as a continuous variable (p = 0.003), male gender (p = 0.008), presence of distant metastasis (p < 0.0001), lymph node involvement (p = 0.03), gross residual disease (p < 0.0001), tumor size > 4 cm (p = 0.05), extraglandular invasion (p < 0.004), vascular invasion (p = 0.007), diarrhea (p < .0007), and abnormal postoperative calcitonin (p = 0.02). On multivariate analysis only two factors were significant: the presence of extraglandular invasion, and postoperative gross residual disease. There was no difference in local/regional relapse free rate between patients receiving external radiation and those that did not, but in 40 high risk patients (microscopic residual disease, extraglandular invasion, or lymph node involvement), the local/regional relapse free rate was 86% at 10 years with postoperative external beam radiation (25 patients), and 52% for those with no postoperative external radiation (p = 0.049). To optimize local/regional tumor control, we therefore continue to advise external beam radiation in patients at high risk of local/regional relapse.",

Malaria incidence showed a marked seasonal distribution with two peaks: the first corresponding to the long rainy season, and the second corresponding to the overflowing of Lake Nokoue. The overall Plasmodium falciparum incidence rate was estimated at 84/1,000 person-months, and its prevalence was estimated at over 40% in the two first surveys and 68.9% in the third survey. Multivariate analysis showed that girls and people living in closed houses had a lower risk of clinical malaria. Bed net use was associated with a lower risk of malaria infection. Conversely, children of families owing a pirogue were at higher risk of clinical malaria. Considering the high pyrethroids resistance, indoor residual spraying with either a carbamate or an organophospate insecticide may have a major impact on the malaria burden.",

"This randomised study was designed to compare clinical outcomes for simple aspiration versus tube thoracostomy, in the treatment of the first primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) attack. A randomised trial, comparing simple aspiration with tube thoracostomy, in 137 patients with a first episode of PSP was carried out. Immediate success was obtained in 40 out of the 65 patients (62%) randomly assigned to undergo simple aspiration and in 49 out of the 72 patients (68%) who had been randomly assigned to undergo tube thoracostomy. The 1-week success rates were: 58 (89%) patients in the intention-to-treat simple aspiration group and 63 (88%) patients in the tube thoracostomy group. In the aspiration group, there were more recurrences during the 3-month follow-up period (15 versus 8%), though the difference was not significant. Recurrence rates at 1 and 2 yrs were 16 (22%) and 20 (31%) for patients who had undergone simple aspiration, respectively, and 17 (24%) and 18 (25%) for patients who had undergone tube thoracostomies, respectively. Complications occurred in 5 (7%) patients who had undergone a tube thoracostomy and 1 (2%) patient who had undergone simple aspiration. Analgesia was required in 22 (34%) patients of the simple aspiration group versus 40 (56%) patients of the tube thoracostomy group. These findings suggest that simple aspiration could be an acceptable alternative to tube thoracostomy in the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.",

"We report a prospective, randomized, Phase II study of deferasirox and deferoxamine (DFO) in sickle cell disease patients with transfusional iron overload, with all patients continuing on deferasirox after 24 weeks, for up to 2 years. The primary objective was to evaluate deferasirox safety compared with DFO; long-term efficacy and safety of deferasirox was also assessed. We also report, for the first time, the safety and pharmacokinetics of deferasirox in patients concomitantly receiving hydroxyurea. Deferasirox (n = 135) and DFO (n = 68) had comparable safety profiles over 24 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) secondary to drug administration were reported in 26.7% of patients in the deferasirox cohort and 28.6% in the DFO cohort. Gastrointestinal disorders were more common with deferasirox, including diarrhea (10.4% versus 3.6%) and nausea (5.2% versus 3.6%). The most common AE in the DFO group was injection-site pain irritation, which occurred in 7% of patients. Acute renal failure occurred in one patient on deferasirox who was continued on medication despite progressive impairment of renal function parameters. Serum ferritin levels were reduced in both treatment groups. Patients continuing on deferasirox for up to 2 years demonstrated an absolute median serum ferritin decrease of -614 ng/mL (n = 96). Increasing deferasirox dose was associated with improved response and a continued manageable safety profile. Concomitant hydroxyurea administration (n = 28) did not appear to influence the efficacy, safety (including liver and kidney function), and pharmacokinetic parameters of deferasirox.",

"Subtle clinical cerebellar alterations have been found in migraine. Moreover, abnormalities in visual and motor cortex excitability consistent with a lack of inhibitory efficiency have been described in migraine, and it is known that cerebellum exerts an inhibitory control on cerebral cortex. Here, we investigated if impairment of cerebellar activity on motor cortex, i.e. reduced inhibitory control, can be found in migraine. Ten migraineurs with aura and seven healthy controls underwent a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol to investigate the cerebellar inhibitory drive on motor cortex: a conditioning pulse on right cerebellar cortex was delivered 5, 7, 10, 15 ms before a test stimulus (TS) on contralateral motor cortex. The cerebellar conditioning stimulus inhibits the size of the motor-evoked potential (MEP) produced by the TS alone by approximately 30-50%. Amplitude of MEP to TS alone showed no significant difference between patients and controls. Cerebellar conditioning TMS showed a significant deficit of cerebellar inhibition in migraine patients as compared to controls at all interstimulus intervals (5-15 ms) tested. Cerebellar inhibition is reduced in migraineurs. This could account, at least in part, for the reduced inhibitory efficiency previously showed in cerebral cortex of these patients.",

"Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an inherited arrhythmogenic syndrome leading to sudden cardiac death, partially associated with autosomal dominant mutations in SCN5A, which encodes the cardiac sodium channel alpha-subunit (Nav1.5). To date some SCN5A mutations related with BrS have been identified in voltage sensor of Nav1.5. Here, we describe a dominant missense mutation (R1629Q) localized in the fourth segment of domain IV region (DIV-S4) in a Chinese Han family. The mutation was identified by direct sequencing of SCN5A from the proband's DNA. Co-expression of Wild-type (WT) or R1629Q Nav1.5 channel and hÎ²1 subunit were achieved in human embryonic kidney cells by transient transfection. Sodium currents were recorded using whole cell patch-clamp protocols. No significant changes between WT and R1629Q currents were observed in current density or steady-state activation. However, hyperpolarized shift of steady-state inactivation curve was identified in cells expressing R1629Q channel (WT: V1/2 = -81.1 Â± 1.3 mV, n = 13; R1629Q: V1/2 = -101.7 Â± 1.2 mV, n = 18). Moreover, R1629Q channel showed enhanced intermediate inactivation and prolonged recovery time from inactivation. In summary, this study reveals that R1629Q mutation causes a distinct loss-of-function of the channel due to alter its electrophysiological characteristics, and facilitates our understanding of biophysical mechanisms of BrS.",

"Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is a pro-drug dissociating nitric oxide throughout the body. It dilates cephalic arteries without increasing cerebral blood flow (CBF). GTN induces headache in healthy volunteers and migraine attacks in migraineurs. Acetazolamide (Az) increases CBF but does not dilate cerebral arteries. The hypothesis tested here was that Az, by dilating cerebral arterioles but not arteries and thereby decreasing pulsatile stretching of the wall of the large arteries and their perivascular sensory nerves, would reduce or prevent the GTN-induced headache We tested this hypothesis in 14 healthy volunteers. In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study, they were pretreated with Az or placebo followed on both study days by a GTN infusion of 0.5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) for 20 min. Headache was scored on a verbal rating scale and a headache diary was kept for 12 h. Mean blood velocity of the middle cerebral artery was measured (transcranial Doppler). Our hypothesis was disproved, as Az did not decrease GTN-induced headache. Unexpectedly but interestingly, GTN combined with Az induced more delayed headache than GTN alone. Furthermore, a migraine-like headache was observed in three volunteers, who did not develop migraine after GTN alone. The fact that a suitable pharmacological intervention may trigger migraine in individuals with no prior migraine may suggest that the ability to develop migraine without aura is a quantitative genetic trait.",

"Malaria immunity is modulated by many environmental and epidemiological factors. This study evaluates the influence of a hitherto unstudied environmental-epidemiological factor, namely the impact of human exposure to Anopheles bites on the isotype profile of acquired antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum. In two Senegalese villages where the intensity of exposure to Anopheles bites was markedly different (high and low exposure), specific IgG1 and IgG3 responses to P. falciparum whole schizont extract (WSE) and circumsporozoite protein (CSP) were evaluated at the peak of Anopheles exposure (September) and later (December) in a cohort of 120 children aged 3-8 years. Multivariate analysis showed a significantly lower IgG1 response against P. falciparum WSE and CSP in children highly exposed to Anopheles bites (Gankette) compared to those who were weakly exposed (Mboula). In contrast, in both villages, parasitemia and increasing age were strongly associated with higher IgG1 and IgG3 levels. We hypothesize that high exposure to Anopheles bites could inhibit IgG1-dependent responsiveness to P. falciparum known to induce protective immune responses against malaria. The impact of mosquito saliva on the regulation of specific protective immunity may need to be taken into account in epidemiological studies and trials for malaria vaccines.",

"On occasion, blood pressure rises so precipitously and severily, or the clinical setting in which hypertension occurs is so critical, that prompt pressure lowering becomes crucial to prevent disabling, or even lethal complications. Such hypertensive emergencies more commonly complicate the accelerated phase of untreated or poorly treated hypertension of various etiologies. There is also a group of conditions that qualify as hypertensive emergencies not so much because of the actual height of the pressure, but rather because of complicating disorders that make even moderate pressure elevation harmful. These include aortic dissection, intracranial bleeding and acute left ventricular failure. Two fundamental concepts in the management of hypertensive emergencies are: immediate and effective therapy is required and takes precedence over time-consuming diagnostic procedures; the choice of the drugs will depend on how their time course of action and hemodynamic and metabolic effects meet the needs of the clinical situation. It is well proven that nifedipine reduces Ca-dependent vascular smooth muscle tone by direct interference with transmembrane Ca supply and thereby counteracts every kind of contractile tension development of the vascular wall: the higher the wall tension, the easier relaxation in induced by a given concentration of the compound. Because of this, it has become quite clear from recent studies that: nifedipine is a potent antihypertensive agent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Group A consumed 125 g fermented milk three times a day for the first 4 weeks while group B consumed regular yoghurt under the same conditions. (Groups A and B switched products for the second treatment period). Women taking the test product with a baseline total cholesterol above 190 mg/dl showed a significant reduction in LDL cholesterol. HDL cholesterol was also reduced by the test product. We conclude that the fermented milk may help to reduce LDL levels in hypercholesterolemic adult women.",
"Acute myocardial infarction was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 143 women (18.0%) and 369 men (22.0%). Although most CPCs were reported with similar frequency in women and men, several CPCs were reported more frequently in women (P <â.05). The accuracy of most CPCs in the diagnosis of AMI was low in women and men, with likelihood ratios close to 1. Thirty-one of 34 CPCs (91.2%) showed similar likelihood ratios for the diagnosis of AMI in women and men, and only 3 CPCs (8.8%) seemed to have a sex-specific diagnostic performance with P <â.05 for interaction. These CPCs were related to pain duration (2-30 and >30 minutes) and dynamics (decreasing pain intensity). However, because their likelihood ratios were close to 1, the 3 CPCs did not seem clinically helpful. Similar results were obtained when examining combinations of CPCs (all interactions, P â¥ .05).",
"At baseline, the median CD4+ T-cell count was 150 per cubic millimeter, and the median viral load was 161,000 copies per milliliter, with no significant differences between the two groups.

"Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) are metabolized extraneuronally by catechol-O-methyl-transferase to the metanephrines (MNs), normetanephrine (NMN) and metanephrine (MN). Subjects in this study received infusions of tritium-labeled NE and E. Concentrations of MNs and catecholamines were measured in plasma flowing into and out of the heart, forearm, lungs, kidneys, mesenteric organs (gastrointestinal tract, spleen, and pancreas), liver, and adrenals to examine the regional production of MNs from circulating and locally released catecholamines. NE spillover from mesenteric organs and kidneys accounted for 64% of the spillover from all tissues. There was detectable spillover of E from most extraadrenal tissues, but 91% was from the adrenals. The production of MNs from locally released and circulating catecholamines varied widely among tissues. The liver made the largest contribution to removal of circulating NE (57%) and E (32%) and the largest contribution to the production of NMN (54%) and MN (37%) from metabolism of circulating catecholamines. In all other tissues more NMN was produced from locally released than from circulating NE. Thus, the metabolism of circulating NE was responsible for only 19% of the total production of NMN. An even smaller portion (6%) of plasma MN was derived from metabolism of circulating E. Most plasma MN (91%) was produced within the adrenals, which also provided the largest single source (23%) of NMN. The regional variation in extraneuronal production of MNs indicates considerable heterogeneity in how circulating and locally released catecholamines are handled by different tissues. The substantial contribution of the adrenals to the production of MNs explains the extraordinary sensitivity of these metabolites for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.",

"In a randomized prospective open study the authors followed up the influence of latanoprost 0.005 % on the changes of the ciliary body thickness by means of ultrasound biomicroscopy. The study group consisted of 40 eyes of 24 patients with primary open angle glaucoma not treated with latanoprost before. At the entry visit and further after 2 and 8 weeks, according to the study protocol, a complex ophthalmologic examination was performed; especially anatomical relation between the cornea and the iris, configuration of the anterior chamber angle, and furthermore the best visual acuity for far and near, intraocular pressure measurement by means of applanation method, anterior chamber depth, and the pupil size. The thickness of the ciliary body was measured in the distance of 1,500 microm (T1), 2,000 microm (T2), and 2,500 microm (T3) from the scleral spur. A slight decrease of T1 comparing with the initial values was found: from 668 +/- 117 microm in the beginning, to 633 +/- 127 microm after two weeks, and 614 +/- 147 microm after eight weeks of treatment. In the case of T2 measurement, the situation is similar; the decrease of the values was smaller than in T1. The above-mentioned differences were not statistically significant. Practically no differences were found in the T3 measured values. The intraocular pressure during the follow-up decreased markedly - from 21.3 +/- 4.2 mm Hg to 18.8 +/-3.3 mm Hg (week 2) and 17.6 +/- 3.7 mm Hg (week 8). The average lowering of the intraocular pressure (IOP) by 2.5 mm Hg (i.e. by 11.7%) found between the initial values and values after two weeks of treatment was found as statistically significant (P-value = 0.0001) as well as the difference between the initial values and values after eight weeks of treatment. No statistical significant difference was found between IOP values measured after two and eight weeks of treatment. All other followed-up parameters (anterior chamber depth, size of the pupil, visual acuity, and external finding) remained during the eight weeks period unchanged. Our results are in the congruity with one of hypotheses of the latanoprost acting - compacting of the interstitium and following opening of the porosities among the muscles fibers bundles of the ciliary body cause the increase of the intraocular fluid outflow and marked decrease of the intraocular pressure. To explain the mechanisms affecting the ciliary body in detail, more studies are needed.",

"Although acute myocardial infarction (AMI) occurs primarily in the elderly, this disease also affects young adults. Few studies have, however, presented data on relatively young patients hospitalized with AMI. The objectives of this population-based study were to examine recent trends in the magnitude, clinical characteristics, management, and in-hospital and long-term outcomes associated with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in patients aged 30 to 54 years. We reviewed the medical records of 955 residents of the Worcester (Massachusetts) metropolitan area aged 30 to 54 years who were hospitalized for an initial STEMI or NSTEMI in 6 biennial periods from 1999 to 2009 at 11 greater Worcester medical centers. From 1999 to 2009, the proportion of young adults hospitalized with an STEMI decreased from approximately 2/3 to 2/5 of all patients with an initial AMI. Patients with STEMI were less likely to have a history of heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and kidney disease than those with NSTEMI. Both groups received similar effective medical therapies during their acute hospitalization. In-hospital clinical complications and mortality were low and no significant differences in these end points were observed between patients with STEMI and NSTEMI or with regard to 1-year postdischarge death rates (1.9% vs 2.8%). The present results demonstrate recent decreases in the proportion of relatively young patients diagnosed with an initial STEMI. Patients with STEMI and NSTEMI had similar in-hospital outcomes and long-term survival. Trends in these and other important outcomes warrant continued monitoring.",
"This study has evaluated whether candesartans prevent the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and decrease type III procollagen-N-peptide (PIIINP) levels. A total of 153 patients with AF were enrolled in this study. Three groups of patients were compared; candesartan group was treated with candesartan plus bepridil (n = 52); and carvedilol group with carvedilol plus bepridil (n = 51); and bepridil group with bepridil alone (n = 50). The primary end point was length of time to the recurrence of AF and all patients were ultimately followed-up for 730 days. Serum levels of the biomarkers were measured at baseline and after 24 months. Maintenance of sinus rhythm was achieved in 25 (50%) patients in bepridil group, 37 (73%) in candesartan group, and 34 (67%) in carvedilol group, giving a bepridil group/candesartan group hazard ratio of 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.21-0.63; P = 0.03). Candesartan significantly decreased PIIINP levels at 24 months than at baseline in sinus rhythm group (0.57 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.05 U/mL, P = 0.04) and did not decrease PIIINP levels in the recurrence group.

Adding vildagliptin as a second oral glucose-lowering agent resulted in lowering HbA1c to <7% without weight gain, hypoglycemia or peripheral oedema in a higher proportion of patients than comparator oral antidiabetic drugs, with no differences in the reported number of adverse events.",
"HIV-associated tuberculous meningitis (TBM) has high mortality. Aside from the devastating impact of multidrug resistance (MDR) on survival, little is understood about the influence of other bacterial factors on outcome. This study examined the influence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance, bacterial lineage, and host vaccination status on outcome in patients with HIV-associated TBM. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from the cerebrospinal fluid of 186 patients enrolled in two studies of HIV-associated TBM in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, were tested for resistance to first-line antituberculosis drugs. Lineage genotyping was available for 122 patients. The influence of antituberculosis drug resistance and M. tuberculosis lineage on 9-month mortality was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox multiple regression models. Isoniazid (INH) resistance without rifampin resistance was associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18 to 2.66; P = 0.005), and multidrug resistance was uniformly fatal (n = 8/8; adjusted HR, 5.21, 95% CI, 2.38 to 11.42; P < 0.0001). The hazard ratio for INH-resistant cases was greatest during the continuation phase of treatment (after 3 months; HR, 5.05 [95% CI, 2.23 to 11.44]; P = 0.0001). Among drug-susceptible cases, patients infected with the "modern" Beijing lineage strains had lower mortality than patients infected with the "ancient" Indo-Oceanic lineage (HR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.61]; P = 0.001). Isoniazid resistance, multidrug resistance, and M. tuberculosis lineage are important determinants of mortality in patients with HIV-associated TBM. Interventions which target these factors may help reduce the unacceptably high mortality in patients with TBM.",
"P wave duration and PWD are found to be prolonged in hyperthyroid patients with GD. Both propylthiouracil and methimazole reduce the P wave duration and dispersion. Thus, we can conclude that improvements in atrial conduction properties are not associated with the type of ATD but with only achievement of euthyroidism.",
"In experimental studies, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) models has been associated with enhanced neovascularization and myogenesis. Clinical data however, are scarce. Therefore, the present study evaluates the safety and feasibility of intramyocardial MSC injection in nine patients, shortly after AMI during short-term and 5-year follow-up. Periprocedural safety analysis demonstrated one transient ischemic attack. No other adverse events related to MSC treatment were observed during 5-year follow-up. Clinical events were compared to a nonrandomized control group comprising 45 matched controls. A 5-year event-free survival after MSC-treatment was comparable to controls (89 vs. 91Â %, Pâ=â0.87). Echocardiographic imaging for evaluation of left ventricular function demonstrated improvements up to 5Â years after MSC treatment. These findings were not significantly different when compared to controls. The present safety and feasibility study suggest that intramyocardial injection of MSC in patients shortly after AMI is feasible and safe up to 5-year follow-up.",

"Prevalence and prognostic value of conduction disturbances in patients with the Brugada syndrome (BrS) remains poorly known. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) from 325 patients with BrS (47 Â± 13 years, 258 men) with spontaneous (n = 143) or drug-induced (n = 182) type 1 ECG were retrospectively reviewed. Two hundred twenty-six patients (70%) were asymptomatic, 73 patients (22%) presented with unexplained syncope, and 26 patients (8%) presented with sudden death or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator appropriated therapies at diagnosis or during a mean follow-up of 48 Â± 34 months. P-wave duration of â¥120 ms was present in 129 patients (40%), first degree atrioventricular block (AVB) in 113 (35%), right bundle branch block (BBB) in 90 (28%), and fascicular block in 52 (16%). Increased P-wave duration, first degree AVB, and right BBB were more often present in patients after drug challenge than in patients with spontaneous type 1 ST elevation. Left BBB was present in 3 patients. SCN5A mutation carriers had longer P-wave duration and longer PR and HV intervals. In multivariate analysis, first degree AVB was independently associated with sudden death or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator appropriated therapies (odds ratio 2.41, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 5.73, p = 0.046) together with the presence of syncope and spontaneous type 1 ST elevation. In conclusion, conduction disturbances are frequent and sometimes diffuse in patients with BrS. First degree AVB is independently linked to outcome and may be proposed to be used for individual risk stratification.",
"Little is known about the pharmacokinetics of hydroxyurea in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).

Fifteen adults received hydroxyurea capsules and tablets in a randomized cross-over study. Eleven children received hydroxyurea tablets. The results showed bioequivalence between capsules and tablets in adults. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different between adults and children. Considerable inter-individual variability was noted.",
"The majority of patients with migraine headaches are treated in non-specialized institutions though data on treatment outcomes are largely derived from tertiary care centers. The current non-interventional study explores efficacy and tolerability outcomes of patients with episodic migraines receiving topiramate as preventive agent in a general practice setting. A total of 366 patients (87% female, mean age 41.8 +/- 11.6 years) were eligible for migraine prevention and treated with flexible dose topiramate for 6 months (core phase), and optionally for a total of 12 months (follow-up phase). Overall, 261 patients (77.7% of safety analysis set, SAF) completed the core phase. Reasons for discontinuation included adverse events (2.1%), lost to follow-up (1.8%), other reasons (1.5%), and end of therapy (0.3%) though in the majority of patients who discontinued no reasons were listed. The median daily dose at endpoint was 50 mg/day (range, 25-187.5 mg/day). The median days with migraine headaches decreased from 6.0 to 1.2 days (p < 0.001), median pain intensity score decreased from 17.0 to 3.2 points (p < 0.001). In women with reported menstruation-associated migraine, the median number of migraine attacks decreased from 4.0 to 0.9 (p < 0.001). Absenteeism as well as triptan use decreased significantly, and significant improvements in activities of daily living and quality of life were reported. The most frequently reported AEs were paraesthesia (4.2%) and nausea (3%). Results suggest that migraine prevention with topiramate in a general practice is generally well tolerated and associated with a significant improvement in migraine headaches and related functional impairment.",
"The results of a tuberculin skin test (TST) screening program offered to employees of services for homeless people in MontrÃ©al from 1998 to 2005 were analyzed to assess the occupational risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection. Employees with no known contact with TB were selected among volunteer participants. They were followed in two dynamic cohorts: individuals with a negative two-step baseline TST (cohort A) and individuals with a negative single baseline TST (cohort B). We estimated the prevalences of initial positive TST, boosting effect, and conversion rate. The average age of the workers was 38.9 years. The prevalence of an initial positive TST was 12.9%. A booster effect was observed in 5.1% of workers who completed a two-step TST. The incidence of conversion was 2.3/100 person-years for cohort A (n=93) and 3.5/100 person-years for cohort B (n=221). The incidence of conversion was not significantly associated with any of the demographics or workplace factors investigated. Our findings are comparable to the rates reported among community workers, whose risk is higher than the average health worker. This suggests that there are occasional unidentified contagious cases among the homeless individuals of participating institutions.",

"The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of remote magnetic navigation (RMN) with open-irrigated catheter vs. manual catheter navigation (MCN) in performing atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. We searched in PubMed (1948-2013) and EMBASE (1974-2013) studies comparing RMN with MCN. Outcomes considered were AF recurrence (primary outcome), pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), procedural complications, and data on procedure's performance. Odds ratios (OR) and mean difference (MD) were extracted and pooled using a random-effect model. Confidence in the estimates of the obtained effects (quality of evidence) was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. We identified seven controlled trials, six non-randomized and one randomized, including a total of 941 patients. Studies were at high risk of bias. No difference was observed between RMN and MCN on AF recurrence [OR 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.65, P = 0.32] or PVI (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.11-1.47, P = 0.17). Remote magnetic navigation was associated with less peri-procedural complications (Peto OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.19-0.88, P = 0.02). Mean fluoroscopy time was reduced in RMN group (-22.22 min; 95% CI -42.48 to -1.96, P = 0.03), although the overall duration of the procedure was longer (60.91 min; 95% CI 31.17 to 90.65, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, RMN is not superior to MCN in achieving freedom from recurrent AF at mid-term follow-up or PVI. The procedure implies less peri-procedural complications, requires a shorter fluoroscopy time but a longer total procedural time. For the low quality of the available evidence, a proper designed randomized controlled trial could turn the direction and the effect of the dimensions explored.",

"We assessed whether implementation of a combination of interventions in London tuberculosis clinics raised the levels of HIV test offers, acceptance and coverage. A stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted across 24 clinics. Interventions were training of clinical staff and provision of tailor-made information resources with or without a change in clinic policy from selective to universal HIV testing. The primary outcome was HIV test acceptance amongst those offered a test, before and after the intervention; the secondary outcome was an offer of HIV testing. Additionally, the number and proportion of HIV tests among all clinic attendees (coverage) was assessed. 1,315 patients were seen in 24 clinics. The offer and coverage of testing rose significantly in clinics without (p = 0.002 and p = 0.004, respectively) and with an existing policy of universal testing (p = 0.02 and p = 0.04, respectively). However, the level of HIV test acceptance did not increase in 18 clinics without routine universal testing (p = 0.76) or the six clinics with existing universal testing (p = 0.40). The intervention significantly increased the number of HIV tests offered and proportion of participants tested, although acceptance did not change significantly. However, the magnitude of increase is modest due to the high baseline coverage.",

"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a recently discovered metabolic regulator. Exogenous FGF21 produces beneficial metabolic effects in animal models; however, the translation of these observations to humans has not been tested. Here, we studied the effects of LY2405319 (LY), a variant of FGF21, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind proof-of-concept trial in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Patients received placebo or 3, 10, or 20 mg of LY daily for 28 days. LY treatment produced significant improvements in dyslipidemia, including decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a shift to a potentially less atherogenic apolipoprotein concentration profile. Favorable effects on body weight, fasting insulin, and adiponectin were also detected. However, only a trend toward glucose lowering was observed. These results indicate that FGF21 is bioactive in humans and suggest that FGF21-based therapies may be effective for the treatment of selected metabolic disorders.",
"The ANTIPAF trial was a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial analyzing the AF burden (percentage of days with documented episodes of paroxysmal AF) during a 12-month follow-up as the primary study end point. Four hundred thirty patients with documented paroxysmal AF without structural heart disease were randomized to placebo or 40 mg olmesartan per day. Concomitant therapy with ARBs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiarrhythmic drugs was prohibited. Patients were followed using daily transtelephonic ECG (tele-ECG) recordings independent of symptoms. The intention-to-treat population of the trial encompassed 425 patients (placebo group, n=211; olmesartan group, n=214). A total of 87 818 tele-ECGs were analyzed in these patients during follow-up (placebo group, 44 888 ECGs; olmesartan group, 42 930 ECGs). Thus, a mean of 207 tele-ECGs were recorded per patient. The primary end point (AF burden) was not different between the 2 groups (P=0.770). Secondary outcome parameters, including quality of life, also were not different. In particular, time to first AF recurrence, time to persistent AF, and number of hospitalizations were not different between the 2 groups. The time to prescription of recovery medication (amiodarone) was the only parameter showing an intergroup difference, with earlier prescription of amiodarone in the placebo group (P=0.022).",

"The use of linezolid for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is limited by dose- and time-dependent toxicity. Recently, we reported a case of pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between linezolid and clarithromycin that resulted in increased linezolid exposure. The aim of this prospective pharmacokinetic study is to quantify the effect of clarithromycin on the exposure of linezolid. Subjects were included in an open-label, single-centre, single-arm, fixed-order pharmacokinetic interaction study. All subjects received 300 mg linezolid twice daily during the entire study, consecutively co-administered with 250 mg and 500 mg clarithromycin once daily. Steady-state serum curves of linezolid and clarithromycin were analysed using validated methods, and differences between pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Linezolid exposure increased by a median (interquartile range) of 44% (23-102%, p=0.043) after co-administration of 500 mg clarithromycin (n=5) compared to baseline, whereas 250 mg clarithromycin had no statistically significant effect. Co-administration was well tolerated by most patients; none experienced severe adverse effects. One patient reported common toxicity criteria grade 2 gastrointestinal adverse events. In this study, we showed that clarithromycin significantly increased linezolid serum exposure after combining clarithromycin with linezolid in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis patients. The drug-drug interaction is possibly P-glycoprotein-mediated. Due to large interpatient variability, therapeutic drug monitoring is advisable to determine individual effect size.",
"Six Medical Centers in France were involved in a prospective study evaluating the efficacy of [131I]metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) in the treatment of malignant pheochromocytoma. Fifteen patients aged from 28 to 75 years bearing tumor sites demonstrating a good MIBG uptake were included in this study. Catecholamines were elevated in 13/14 cases, VMA in 9/14 and metanephrines in 13/14. Two to 11 therapeutic activities of 131I-MIBG were administered, with a mean number of therapeutic doses per patient of 4 and a mean single activity of 4.7 GBq (range 2.9 to 9.25 GBq). Seven patients were alive, and seven patients died 6 to 29 months after their first MIBG administration (mean follow-up of 36 months); 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Two patients had a partial tumor response only, 4 had a hormonal response only, and 3 had both a partial tumor response and a hormonal response (complete in 2 cases). Six patients did not respond to the treatment, 4 of them died. Of the 9 responding patients, 4 relapsed, 3 of whom died subsequently.

"The percentage of patients with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with door-to-balloon (D2B) times â¤90Â minutes is used as a hospital performance measure for public reporting. Patients can be excluded from reporting for nonsystem-related delays. How exclusions impact D2B time reporting at the hospital level is unknown. The percentage of patients having nonsystem delays for primary PCI at the hospital level was calculated using data from the Acute Coronary Treatment Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get with the Guidelines Registry. Hospitals were categorized based on tertiles of percentage of excluded patients: low, â¤7.1%; intermediate, >7.1% to 11.2%; and high, >11.2%. From January 1, 2007, to March 31, 2011, 43,909 patients from 294 hospitals were included. The percentage of exclusions differed substantially among hospitals (0% to 68%, median 9.2% [interquartile range 5.6% to 13.5%]). Exclusion reasons included vascular access difficulty (7.6%), cardiac arrest/intubation (38%), and PCI procedural difficulties (20%). Including patients with nonsystem delays significantly increased D2B times by â¤2Â minutes for each group. The effect was larger on the proportion of patients having a D2B â¤90Â minutes (low 83.6% to 85%, intermediate 82.9% to 86.3%, high 82% to 87.5%, pÂ <0.001, for all). If a criterion of having â¥90% of patients with D2B â¤90Â minutes was used, excluding patients with nonsystem delays significantly increased the proportion of patients meeting this goal for each group: low, 28% to 37%; intermediate, 17.7% to 37.5%; and high, 14% to 52% (all p <0.01). In conclusion, the proportion of patients excluded from D2B reporting varies substantially among hospitals. This has a greater impact on percentage of patients with D2B time â¤90Â minutes than on median D2B times.",

"An effective malaria vaccine is a public health priority. Proteins expressed during the blood-stage of the parasite life cycle have been proposed as good vaccine candidates. No such blood-stage vaccine, however, is available against Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest Plasmodium species. We show here that P. falciparum serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5) is a potential vaccine immunogen. We have constructed a new recombinant molecule of SERA5, namely SE36, based on previously reported SE47' molecule by removing the serine repeats. Epidemiological study in the holo-endemic population of Solomon Islands shows highly significant correlation of sero-conversion and malaria protective immunity against this antigen. Animal experiments using non-human primates, and a human phase 1a clinical trial assessed SE36 vaccine immunogenicity. Vaccination of squirrel monkeys with SE36 protein and aluminum hydroxyl gel (SE36/AHG) conferred protection against high parasitemia and boosted serum anti-SE36 IgG after P. falciparum parasite challenge. SE36/AHG was highly immunogenic in chimpanzees, where serum anti-SE36 IgG titers last more than one year. Phase 1a clinical trial (current controlled trials, ISRCTN78679862) demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity of SE36/AHG with 30 healthy adults and 10 placebo controls. Three subcutaneous administrations of 50 and 100microg dose of SE36/AHG were well-tolerated, with no severe adverse events; and resulted in 100% sero-conversion in both dose arms. The current research results for SE36/AHG provide initial clinical validation for future trials and suggest clues/strategies for further vaccine development.",

"The aim of this study was to determine the impact of pitavastatin on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Twenty-five hypercholesterolemic patients (8 male, 17 female; age 66 +/- 13, 21-80 years) who had not received anti-dyslipidemic agents and had LDL-C levels of more than 160 mg/dL were examined. Biochemical factors were measured at baseline and after treatment with pitavastatin (2 mg/day) for 6 months. Serum levels of LOX-1 with apolipoprotein B-100 particle ligand and a soluble form of LOX-1 (sLOX-1) were measured by ELISA. All subjects completed the study with no adverse side effects. Total-C (268 +/- 26 vs. 176 +/- 17 mg/dL), LDL-C (182 +/- 21 vs. 96 +/- 14 mg/dL), and LOX-1 ligand (867 +/- 452 vs. 435 +/- 262 ng/mL) were reduced with pitavastatin treatment (P < 0.0001 for each). Significant decreases in triacylglycerols were noted (P < 0.0001), but there were no changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After 6 months, there were no significant changes in high-sensitivity CRP or soluble LOX-1. At baseline, there were no significant correlations between LOX-1 ligand and either LDL-C or sLOX-1. The decrease in LOX-1 ligand was not correlated with the decrease in LDL-C, but was correlated with the decrease in sLOX-1 (r = 0.47, P < 0.05). In conclusion, pitavastatin therapy had beneficial effects on markers of oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic subjects. Serum levels of LOX-1 ligand may be a useful biomarker of the pleiotropic effects of statins.",

"After 6 months of ACTH gel therapy, 8 of 14 (57%) patients achieved a complete (n = 1) or partial (n = 7) remission. In the low-dose ACTH gel group (16 units), urinary protein fell from 6709 + 953 to 2224 + 489âmg/24 hrs (P < 0.001). In contrast, 2 of 6 patients in the 32-unit group achieved partial remission, but aggregate proteinuria (5324 + 751 to 5154 + 853âmg/24 hours) did not change. Urinary VEGF increased from 388 to 1346âpg/mg urinary creatinine (P < 0.02) in the low-dose group but remained unchanged in the high-dose group.",
"In India, chloroquine has been replaced by a combination of artesunate and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS-SP) for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Other available combinations, artemether-lumefantrine (AM-LF) and artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ), not included in the national program, are widely used by private practitioners. Little is known about the therapeutic efficacy of these artemisinin combinations and the prevalence of molecular markers associated with antimalarial drug resistance. A total of 157 patients with P. falciparum monoinfection were recruited and randomized into three study groups (AS-SP, AM-LF, and AS-MQ). All patients were followed up for 42 days to study the clinical and parasitological responses according to the WHO protocol (2009). We assessed the polymorphism of the pfATPase6, pfcrt, pfdhfr, and pfdhps genes by the DNA-sequencing method. The PCR-corrected therapeutic efficacies of AS-SP, AM-LF, and AS-MQ were 90.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.793 to 0.969), 95.9% (95% CI, 0.860 to 0.995), and 100% (95% CI, 0.927 to 1.00), respectively. No specific mutational pattern was observed in the pfATPase6 gene. All isolates had a K76T mutation in the pfcrt gene. In the pfdhfr-pfdhps genotype, quadruple mutation was frequent, and quintuple mutation was documented in 6.3% of P. falciparum isolates. The significant failure rate of AS-SP (9.5%), although within the limit (10%) for drug policy change, was due to SP failure because of prevailing mutations in pfdhfr, I(51)R(59)N(108), with pfdhps, G(437) and/or E(540). The efficacy of this ACT needs periodic monitoring. Artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-mefloquine are effective alternatives to the artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination.",
"The efficacy of combining rate and pressure reduction during weaning by synchronous intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) were compared with weaning by patient triggered ventilation (PTV) (pressure reduction alone) in two randomised trials. Regardless of ventilation mode, pressure was reduced to the same level according to the size of the infant. In the first trial, the SIMV rate was also reduced progressively to a minimum of 20 breaths/minute, and in the second to five breaths/minute. Forty premature infants aged 15 days of age or less were randomly allocated into each trial. No significant differences were found in the first trial between ventilation modes in either the duration of weaning or the number of infants in whom weaning failed. In the second trial, the duration of weaning was shorter by PTV than by SIMV (median 24 hours, range 7-432 v 50 hours, range 12-500; p < 0.05); weaning failed in two infants in the PTV group and in five in the SIMV group. It is concluded that weaning by a combination of pressure and rate reduction, such as can be achieved during SIMV, offers no significant advantage over pressure reduction alone.",
"Because animal studies have demonstrated that mechanical ventilation at high volume and pressure can be deleterious to the lungs, limitation of airway pressure, allowing hypercapnia if necessary, is already used for ventilation of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Whether a systematic and more drastic reduction is necessary is debatable. A multicenter randomized study was undertaken to compare a strategy aimed at limiting the end-inspiratory plateau pressure to 25 cm H2O, using tidal volume (VT) below 10 ml/kg of body weight, versus a more conventional ventilatory approach (with regard to current practice) using VT at 10 ml/kg or above and close to normal PaCO2. Both arms used a similar level of positive end-expiratory pressure. A total of 116 patients with ARDS and no organ failure other than the lung were enrolled over 32 mo in 25 centers. The two groups were similar at inclusion. Patients in the two arms were ventilated with different VT (7.1 +/- 1.3 versus 10.3 +/- 1.7 ml/kg at Day 1, p < 0.001) and plateau pressures (25.7 +/- 5. 0 versus 31.7 +/- 6.6 cm H2O at Day 1, p < 0.001), resulting in different PaCO2 (59.5 +/- 15.0 versus 41.3 +/- 7.6 mm Hg, p < 0.001) and pH (7.28 +/- 0.09 versus 7.4 +/- 0.09, p < 0.001), but a similar level of oxygenation. The new approach did not reduce mortality at Day 60 (46.6% versus 37.9% in control subjects, p = 0.38), the duration of mechanical ventilation (23.1 +/- 20.2 versus 21.4 +/- 16. 3 d, p = 0.85), the incidence of pneumothorax (14% versus 12%, p = 0. 78), or the secondary occurrence of multiple organ failure (41% versus 41%, p = 1). We conclude that no benefit could be observed with reduced VT titrated to reach plateau pressures around 25 cm H2O compared with a more conventional approach in which normocapnia was achieved with plateau pressures already below 35 cm H2O.",

"High levels of catecholamines in pheochromocytoma (PHEO) are associated with risk of cardiovascular complications. In this study, we looked for potential differences in markers of oxidative stress - vitamin C, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in PHEO before and after the operation. We studied 18 subjects with PHEO who were examined before and approximately one year after the successful tumor removal (free of disease). All subjects had elevated urinary epinephrine and/or norepinephrine levels before the operation. Vitamin C levels increased significantly after the operation from 61+/-27 to 77+/-20 micromol/l (P=0.02), and MDA decreased significantly after the tumor removal from 2.6+/-0.4 to 2.0+/-0.6 micromol/l (P=0.01). However, no changes were found in SOD activity before and after the operation. In conclusion, increased catecholamine production in PHEO is accompanied by decreased levels of vitamin C and increased levels of MDA which may indicate the activation of oxidative stress in PHEO. Successful operation was associated with lowering of oxidative stress by using both biomarkers. On the contrary, no changes in SOD activity before and after the tumor removal were noted.",
"Studies suggest that thoracic computed tomography (TCT) is superior to plain chest X-ray (CXR) in the detection of blunt chest injury. This study examined whether TCT provides additional information to routine CXR findings, whether the additional information results in a management change, and whether TCT is more useful in patients with particular mechanisms of injury. Level I trauma patients were prospectively placed into two groups. Control (CTL) group patients underwent TCT as a result of either clinical chest symptoms or abnormal CXR findings. The mechanism (MECH) group contained patients who had no thoracic signs and a negative CXR but experienced severe mechanisms of injury. TCT identified injuries not seen on CXR in 66 per cent of the CTL group and 39 per cent of the MECH group. Identification of these injuries resulted in a highly significant (P < 0.001) change in clinical management in 20 per cent of the CTL group and 5 per cent of the MECH group. TCT appears to be most helpful in the acute evaluation of trauma patients when roentgenographic evidence of chest injury exists and provides additional information impacting on the care of the patient 20 per cent of the time. In patients with severe mechanisms of injury and normal CXRs TCT expeditiously identifies occult chest injuries that require treatment in 5 per cent of this population.",

"In this project we have prospectively studied the erythropoietic activity in patients with sickle cell anaemia (SS) before and after treatment with hydroxyurea (HU). Some of the patients were enrolled in a double-blind placebo controlled trial of HU in patients with SS and others were enrolled in an open label study. Determinants of erythropoietic activity included the reticulocyte count, red blood cell (RBC) survival by the 51Cr method, plasma 59Fe clearance, plasma iron turnover (PIT), erythron transferrin uptake (ETU), RBC production/destruction rate, and RBC Fe utilization. Therapy with HU increased the mean corpuscular volume (MCV), haemoglobin (Hb)F, RBC survival and t1/2 59Fe clearance; it decreased the reticulocyte count, the white blood cell (WBC) count, ETU, and the PIT. Most of the changes in parameters of erythropoiesis could be explained by the increase in 51Cr RBC survival after therapy with HU. Together the data showed that in selected patients the net effect of HU on Hb level was a function of the difference between the suppressive effect of HU (decreased RBC production) and the increase in RBC survival. In the majority of patients who responded to HU, there was a preferential effect on RBC survival.",

"Some have suggested a protective effect of tuberculosis (TB) infection on allergic disease risk, but few studies have examined the association between the two. We therefore investigated whether TB disease and bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccination in early life protect against allergic disease. Information on allergic disease symptoms, past TB disease, and BCG vaccination as well as potential confounding factors was gathered by parental questionnaire from a randomly selected subset of 23,901 8- to 12-yr-old schoolchildren in 20 centers in both developed and developing countries. Children were also physically examined for flexural eczema and underwent skin prick testing. Pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across study centers were calculated, using random effects meta-analysis models. There were 245 (1.0%) reported cases of TB disease, and 66.3% (15,857) of all children received the BCG vaccine. Asthma, hay fever, and flexural eczema symptoms in the past year as well as flexural eczema on skin examination were all positively linked to a history of TB (adjusted pooled OR 'wheeze in the past year' = 2.27, 95% CI 1.52-3.41; adjusted pooled OR 'hay fever symptoms in the past year' = 2.23, 1.22-4.09; adjusted pooled OR 'flexural eczema symptoms in the past year' = 3.21, 2.01-5.12; adjusted pooled OR 'flexural eczema on skin examination' = 4.04, 1.71-9.56). Even higher risk estimates were seen for severe asthma and eczema symptoms [adjusted OR = 4.02 (2.17-7.47) and adjusted OR = 6.31 (2.19-18.17), respectively]. There was no significant association between past TB and skin prick test positivity (adjusted pooled OR = 1.32, 0.87-2.02). BCG vaccination during the first year of life was also not associated with any of the allergy outcomes. We found a uniform positive association between TB and all allergic disease outcomes, including eczema on skin examination. As this was a cross-sectional study, it is unclear whether this positive association is attributable to a causal relationship, and further longitudinal studies are required.",
"Participants with baseline BMI 35+ had greater reductions in mean BMI, body weight (as percentage change), and waist circumference in the coach-led group intervention, compared to usual care and the self-directed individual intervention (P < 0.05 for all).

"Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are Ï3-polyunsaturated fatty acids mainly contained in the blue-backed fish oil, and are effective in decreasing the lipids disorder and the cardiovascular incidence among diabetic patients. Moreover, it has been suggested that EPA and DHA may improve the insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. However, the clinical effects of EPA and DHA on glucose metabolism remain unclear. We aimed to clarify the effects of EPA/DHA treatment on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study was a multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial involving 30 elderly type 2 diabetic patients on a liquid diet. Their exercises were almost zero and the content of their meals was strictly managed and understood well. Therefore, the difference by the individual's life was a minimum. The subjects were divided into two groups: those receiving EPA/DHA-rich liquid diet [EPA/DHA (+)] or liquid diet lacking EPA/DHA [EPA/DHA (-)]. Changes in factors related to glucose and lipid metabolism were assessed after the three-month study. Serum concentrations of EPA rose in EPA/DHA (+), although the levels of DHA and fasting C-peptide remained unchanged in EPA/DHA (+). In addition, there was a significant decline in the fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting remnant-like particles and apolipoprotein (apo) B in EPA/DHA (+), compared with the values in EPA/DHA (-). EPA/DHA-rich diet might improve glucose metabolism in elderly type 2 diabetic patients on a liquid diet. This phenomenon may be due to the improved insulin resistance mediated by the rise in serum EPA concentrations.",

"Hydroxyurea (HU) is the first widely used treatment to have an impact on the severity of disease in adult patients with sickle cell anemia, but limited data are available for younger patients or those with variant genotypes. We reviewed 324 months of experience with HU in 16 patients from 5.3 to 18.4 years of age treated for 6 to 50 months. The major toxicity was reversible neutropenia. Linear growth continued unchanged, and all patients gained weight. Hematologic results were similar to those reported in adults with increases in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and total and fetal hemoglobin (HbF). We noted that the maximal hematologic effects occurred at less than the maximum dose. Clinically, patients experienced an 80% reduction in episodes of acute chest syndrome and a reduced need for blood transfusion, as well as a 30% decrease in the number of hospitalizations for painful events during HU therapy compared with an equivalent number of months before HU. These highly statistically significant results confirmed the value of HU in ameliorating the severe clinical course of pediatric patients. Similar effects were observed in three patients with sickle beta degrees-thalassemia, sickle beta+-thalassemia, and S-O Arab. Recurrent acute splenic sequestration and progressive symptomatic osteonecrosis were observed during HU. Thus, HU may not prevent the development of complications once organ damage is present. The challenge remains to determine when and to which pediatric patients with sickle cell disease HU should be offered.",

In the majority of centres, electrical cardioversion was performed using a biphasic defibrillator (85.1%). Antiarrhythmic drugs were routinely prescribed prior to electrical cardioversion by 54.3% of hospitals. For pharmacological cardioversion in patients with no or minimal heart disease, the majority of centres (63.1%) chose intravenous flecainide or propafenone, whereas vernakalant was used by 35% of centres in patients with no or minimal-to-moderate structural heart disease. Most centres (71.7%) used a mandatory strategy of 3 weeks of oral anticoagulation prior to elective cardioversion in patients AF > 48 h, but 28.3% performed immediate cardioversion after a transoesophageal echocardiogram.

"We enrolled 176 children, of whom 170 received the study regimen: 86 received NNRTI-based ART, and 84 lopinavir-ritonavir-based ART. The incidence of malaria was lower among children receiving the lopinavir-ritonavir-based regimen than among those receiving the NNRTI-based regimen (1.32 vs. 2.25 episodes per person-year; incidence-rate ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36 to 0.97; P=0.04), as was the risk of a recurrence of malaria after treatment with artemether-lumefantrine (28.1% vs. 54.2%; hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.76; P=0.004). The median lumefantrine level on day 7 after treatment for malaria was significantly higher in the lopinavir-ritonavir group than in the NNRTI group. In the lopinavir-ritonavir group, lumefantrine levels exceeding 300 ng per milliliter on day 7 were associated with a reduction of more than 85% in the 63-day risk of recurrent malaria. A greater number of serious adverse events occurred in the lopinavir-ritonavir group than in the NNRTI group (5.6% vs. 2.3%, P=0.16).

"This case-control study investigated the associations of a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus with the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in Japan. Included were 249 cases within 6 years of onset of PD. Controls were 368 inpatients and outpatients without a neurodegenerative disease. Data on the vascular risk factors and confounders were obtained from a self-administered questionnaire. The vascular risk factors were defined based on drug treatment. Adjustment was made for sex, age, region of residence, pack-years of smoking, years of education, leisure-time exercise, body mass index, dietary intake of energy, cholesterol, vitamin E, alcohol, and coffee and the dietary glycemic index. The proportions of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus prior to the onset of PD were 23.7%, 9.6%, and 4.0%, respectively, in cases. Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with a decreased risk of PD: the adjusted ORs were 0.43 (95% CI: 0.29-0.64), 0.58 (95% CI: 0.33-0.97), and 0.38 (95% CI: 0.17-0.79), respectively. No significant differences were observed in the association of vascular risk factors with the risk of PD between men and women.

"Optimal dosing of basal insulin is needed to achieve target fasting blood glucose and to avoid hypoglycaemia on the other hand in patients of type 2 diabetes on bedtime basal insulin and daytime sulfonylureas. This is an open label, randomised prospective study done in 40 type 2 diabetics having uncontrolled diabetes. Statistical analysis was performed by the SPSS programme for windows, version 17.0. Continuous variables are presented as mean +/- SD, and categorical variables are presented as absolute numbers and percentage. Data were checked for normality before statistical analysis. Normally distributed continuous variables were compared from baseline to 12th week using paired t-test. The average dose requirement of insulin glargine was 33.55 +/- 11.94 units (mean +/- SD). The average insulin glargine dose requirement per kg body weight was 0.48 +/- 0.17 units/kg body weight. The range of insulin dose was 0.23 to 0.96 units/kg body weight. Dose titration is patient specific and should be done in order to achieve target fasting blood glucose.",
"Patients had highly symptomatic AF (78% paroxysmal, 22% early persistent) and experienced failure of at least one antiarrhythmic drug. Cryoablation produced acute isolation of three or more PVs in 98.2% and all four PVs in 97.6% of patients. PVs isolation was achieved with the balloon catheter alone in 83%.

"Periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) can be induced by several angiographic mechanisms. However, there are limited data on whether these mechanisms differentially affect clinical outcomes. The purpose of our study was to investigate the impact of periprocedural MI on mortality according to the underlying angiographic mechanisms after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. We pooled the databases from 7 coronary stent trials using DES. Periprocedural MI was classified according to its underlying angiographic mechanisms as type 1 (due to side-branch occlusion), type 2 (due to other angiographic complications), or type 3 (without angiographically identifiable causes). Among 10,889 patients treated with DES, 768 (7.1%) experienced periprocedural MI; 463 cases (60.3%) were driven by type 1 cause, 138 (18.0%) by type 2 cause, and 167 (21.7%) by type 3 cause. Mortality rates at 2 years were higher in patients with periprocedural MI than in those without (3.5% vs 2.1%, respectively). Significant differences in mortality were observed according to the angiographic mechanisms of MI (type 1: 2.8% vs type 2: 6.1% vs type 3: 3.1%). After multivariable adjustment, type 2 MI was significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio 2.65, 95% confidence interval 1.77 to 3.96), whereas type 1 and type 3 MI were not related with increased mortality. In conclusion, among patients receiving DES implantation, periprocedural MI was associated with increased mortality, and there were differential associations with mortality according to the underlying angiographic mechanisms.",

We examined the effect of micronutrient supplementation on lymphocyte proliferation response to mycobacteria or T-cell mitogens in a randomized trial conducted on 423 patients with pulmonary TB. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of micronutrients (vitamins A, B-complex, C, E, and selenium) or placebo at the time of initiation of TB treatment. We found no overall effect of micronutrient supplements on lymphocyte proliferative responses to phytohaemagglutinin or purified protein derivatives in HIV-negative and HIV-positive TB patients. Of HIV-negative TB patients, the micronutrient group tended to show higher proliferative responses to concanavalin A than the placebo group, although the clinical relevance of this finding is not readily notable.

Data for the clinical characteristics of 154 patients (median age 69Â years), including Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), treatment, toxicity and outcome were evaluated. Forty-five percent of the patients had an International Prognistic index â¥3 and 16% had a CCI â¥2. The planned R-CHOP schedule was completed by 84% and 75% reached complete remission (CR). In those with CCI â¥2, 67% completed treatment with 46% CR. In patients with a CCI <2, overall survival (OS) after 1, 2 and 5Â years was 84%, 79% and 65% respectively and it was 64%, 48% and 48% for those with CCI â¥2. Grade III/IV toxicity was documented in 53%, most frequently febrile neutropenia (27%) and infections (23%). In multivariate analysis CCI â¥2 and IPI â¥3 were independent risk indicators for OS and grade III/IV toxicity. In conclusion, comorbidity is an independent risk indicator for worse OS in patients with advanced DLBCL treated with R-CHOP by interference with intensive treatment schedules and more grade III/IV toxicity. Future studies are warranted to determine the optimal treatment approach in patients with significant comorbidities.",

"This study investigated the prevalence and determinants of hyperuricemia in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with central obesity. A multicentric hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out in Guangdong Province between August 2011 and March 2012. At each hospital, Chinese T2DM patients with central obesity who were aged over 20 years, whose serum uric acid levels were measured, and who had lived in Guangdong Province for >=1 year, were recruited. Hyperuricemia was defined as serum uric acid >420 Î¼mol/L in men and >360 Î¼mol/L in women. Binary logistic regression was used to assess associated risk factors for hyperu-ricemia. A total of 2,917 T2DM patients with central obesity took part. The overall prevalence of hyperuricemia was 32.6% (36.1% for women, 28.4% for men). Binary logistic regression analyses demonstrated that women (OR: 1.576; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.231, 2.018), high BMI (OR: 1.228; 95% CI: 1.094, 1.379), waist cir-cumference (OR: 1.135; 95% CI: 1.009, 1.276), hypertension (OR: 1.603; 95% CI: 1.263, 2.035), high total cho-lesterol (OR: 1.133; 95% CI: 1.002, 1.281), triglycerides (OR: 1.134; 95% CI: 1.069, 1.203), low HDL-cholesterol (OR: 0.820; 95% CI: 0.677, 0.995) and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (OR: 0.840; 95% CI: 0.815, 0.866) were risk factors associated with hyperuricemia.

"Elevated body mass index (BMI) associates with cardiometabolic traits on observational analysis, yet the underlying causal relationships remain unclear. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses by using a genetic score (GS) comprising 14 BMI-associated SNPs from a recent discovery analysis to investigate the causal role of BMI in cardiometabolic traits and events. We used eight population-based cohorts, including 34,538 European-descent individuals (4,407 type 2 diabetes (T2D), 6,073 coronary heart disease (CHD), and 3,813 stroke cases). A 1 kg/m(2) genetically elevated BMI increased fasting glucose (0.18 mmol/l; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.12-0.24), fasting insulin (8.5%; 95% CI = 5.9-11.1), interleukin-6 (7.0%; 95% CI = 4.0-10.1), and systolic blood pressure (0.70 mmHg; 95% CI = 0.24-1.16) and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.02 mmol/l; 95% CI = -0.03 to -0.01) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; -0.04 mmol/l; 95% CI = -0.07 to -0.01). Observational and causal estimates were directionally concordant, except for LDL-C. A 1 kg/m(2) genetically elevated BMI increased the odds of T2D (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27; 95% CI = 1.18-1.36) but did not alter risk of CHD (OR 1.01; 95% CI = 0.94-1.08) or stroke (OR = 1.03; 95% CI = 0.95-1.12). A meta-analysis incorporating published studies reporting 27,465 CHD events in 219,423 individuals yielded a pooled OR of 1.04 (95% CI = 0.97-1.12) per 1 kg/m(2) increase in BMI. In conclusion, we identified causal effects of BMI on several cardiometabolic traits; however, whether BMI causally impacts CHD risk requires further evidence.",

"Epidemiological patterns of malaria are influenced by different kinds of climate. In Sahelian countries, the link between climatic factors and malaria is still insufficiently quantified. The aim of this work was to conduct a time-series study of rainfall to estimate the increased risk of malaria morbidity. Daily suspected malaria episodes among subjects of all ages were collected retrospectively in three health care facilities between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2003 at Magaria, Niger. These daily numbers were analysed with time-series methods, using generalized additive models with a negative binomial family. The impact of rainfall 40 days before occurrence of suspected malaria episodes was studied using a distributed lag model. More than 13 000 suspected malaria episodes were registered corresponding to an annual cumulative incidence rate of 7.4%. The overall excess risk of suspected malaria episodes for an increase of 1mm of rainfall after 40 days of exposure was estimated at 7.2%. This study allowed to specify the excess risk of rainfall on the occurrence of suspected malaria episodes in an intermediate rainfall area located in the Sahelian region in Niger. It was a first step to a health impact assessment.",

"The aim of this study is to assess whether a text message reminder service designed to support health worker adherence to a revised malaria treatment protocol is feasible and acceptable in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The study took place in six purposively selected health facilities located in the Eastern Highlands Province (EHP) of PNG. Ten text messages designed to remind participants of key elements of the new NMTP were transmitted to 42 health workers twice over a two week period (two text messages per day, Monday to Friday) via the country's largest mobile network provider. The feasibility and acceptability of the text message reminder service was assessed by transmission reports, participant diaries and group discussions. Findings indicate that the vast majority of text messages were successfully transmitted, participants' had regular mobile phone access and that most text messages were read most of the time and were considered both acceptable and clinically useful. Nevertheless, the study found that PNG health workers may tire of the service if the same messages are repeated too many times and that health workers may be reluctant to utilize more comprehensive, yet complementary, resources. In conclusion, a text message reminder service to support health worker adherence to the new malaria treatment protocol is feasible and acceptable in PNG. A rigorous pragmatic, effectiveness trial would be justified on the basis of these findings.",

The LiPA kit was also used to directly test 163 sputum specimens. The results of LiPA identification of Mycobacterium species in clinical isolates were almost identical to those of conventional methods. Compared with standard drug susceptibility testing results for the clinical isolates, LiPA showed a sensitivity and specificity of 98.9% and 97.3%, respectively, for detecting rifampin (RIF)-resistant clinical isolates; 90.6% and 100%, respectively, for isoniazid (INH) resistance; 89.7% and 96.0%, respectively, for pyrazinamide (PZA) resistance; and 93.0% and 100%, respectively, for levofloxacin (LVX) resistance. The LiPA kit could detect target species directly in sputum specimens, with a sensitivity of 85.6%. Its sensitivity and specificity for detecting RIF-, PZA-, and LVX-resistant isolates in the sputum specimens were both 100%, and those for detecting INH-resistant isolates were 75.0% and 92.9%, respectively.

"The most important technical improvements of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) of the latest generation comprise more sophisticated antitachycardia pacing options, stored intracardiac electrograms and biphasic shock capabilities which virtually always allow ICD implantation without thoracotomy. The present study summarizes the first clinical experience with these new devices. In 37 consecutive symptomatic (near sudden death 17, syncope 16, pre-syncope 4) patients aged 56 +/- 10 years with refractory ventricular arrhythmias (presenting arrhythmia: ventricular fibrillation 14, ventricular tachycardia 22, not documented 1), an ICD (Jewel PCD 7219, Medtronic) was implanted. Coronary artery disease was present in 21, dilated cardiomyopathy in 5, valvular heart disease in 2 and various conditions in 8 patients; the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 43 +/- 18%. In 29 patients (78%), the ICD was inserted in a pectoral and in 8 (22%) in an abdominal position. A non-thoracotomy lead (NTL) configuration was successfully implanted in 36/37 patients (97%) (purely transvenous systems in 30, in combination with subcutaneous patch electrode in 6). Surgical complications comprised one pneumothorax, one hemorrhage and one death due to sepsis; during a mean follow-up of 5 +/- 3 months, another patient died of heart failure and 2 revisions (5.4%) for lead problems (1 connector, 1 SQ-patch) became necessary. In 23/37 patients (62%), the ICD was activated after 74 +/- 89 days post implant. 22 of these 23 patients (96%) received one or more appropriate shocks (9 +/- 22 shocks per patient). The actuarial survival was 95% at 6 months. In the present study, an ICD of the newest generation was successfully implanted without thoracotomy in > or = 97% and with purely transvenous systems in > or = 84%. Compared to older systems, this has made the implantation procedure remarkably easier and will most likely lead to a further reduction in mortality and morbidity. Despite the relatively short follow-up, the high incidence of appropriate ICD utilization underscores the high recurrence rate of arrhythmias in this population and suggests that the ICD may be very effective in preventing unnecessary rehospitalizations.",

"This survey is intended to illustrate some major areas relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of sickle cell syndromes that have benefited by the input of molecular genetic approaches. The development of gene mapping techniques has permitted the direct examination of the effect of co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia on clinical severity, providing, for the first time, a direct strategy for investigation of the clinical heterogeneity of these syndromes. In addition, antenatal diagnosis of these disorders is now best done by direct gene mapping whenever appropriate facilities are available. Treatment by manipulation of gamma-globin gene expression has been shown to be an effective means of achieving at least partial reversal of the hemoglobin F to hemoglobin A switch. Whether the magnitude of this reversal is sufficient to interfere with the clinical phenotype of sickle cell disease remains to be determined. Moreover, the agent currently available to accomplish this goal, 5-azacytidine, remains unsuitable for wide-spread clinical application for a variety of reasons. Nonetheless, the molecular geneticist has already demonstrated that desirable effects can be achieved by building on the knowledge of globin gene physiology. This knowledge is best acquired by application of the concepts and methodologies of molecular genetics.",

"Guidelines have recommended non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol as a secondary target for therapy after the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals have been met in patients with hypertriglyceridemia; non-HDL cholesterol is viewed as a surrogate for apolipoprotein (Apo)B, an alternate end point of treatment. The present analysis of the previously reported Simvastatin plus Fenofibrate for Combined Hyperlipidemia (SAFARI) trial assessed the associations of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol with ApoB levels in patients with combined hyperlipidemia treated with combination simvastatin (20 mg) and fenofibrate (160 mg) or simvastatin monotherapy (20 mg). The correlations of these factors were analyzed in the overall modified intent-to-treat population (n = 594) and in patient subgroups stratified by triglyceride (TG) tertiles. Simvastatin plus fenofibrate and simvastatin alone significantly reduced LDL cholesterol, TG, non-HDL cholesterol and ApoB levels and non-HDL cholesterol/ApoB ratio (p < or =0.0004), regardless of the TG level. The greatest reductions occurred with combination treatment. The baseline levels of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol correlated highly with ApoB and were stronger in the lower TG tertiles than in the higher TG tertiles. After 12 weeks, the correlations had changed little with simvastatin monotherapy but had increased substantially with combination therapy and were most improved at high TG levels. In conclusion, these results suggest that both non-HDL cholesterol and ApoB provide similar information in relation to treatment response in patients with combined hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and that non-HDL cholesterol is a good indicator of ApoB-containing lipoproteins, supporting its recommended use as a secondary therapeutic target in these patients.",
"In recent years, the number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus caused by insulin resistance has continued to increase in Japan. Insulin resistance is considered to be closely related to the risk of cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerotic diseases, represented by arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO). Therefore, improvement of insulin resistance is one of the important strategies in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. At present, Î±-glucosidase inhibitors, incretin-related drugs, and thiazolidinediones are among the most important oral hypoglycemic drugs used to improve insulin resistance. In this study, the effect of beraprost sodium, a prostaglandin I2 derivative, in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus was investigated. In type 2 diabetic patients with ASO who were under treatment with pioglitazone, additional treatment with beraprost sodium exerted a significant synergistic effect in reducing the serum HbA1c levels as compared to treatment with pioglitazone alone. This result indicates that concomitant administration of pioglitazone and beraprost sodium may be useful in the treatment of diabetes -mellitus.",
"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasingly diagnosed in obese children and adolescents. Evidence suggests that this disease commonly progresses more rapidly in youth compared with adults and is associated with high rates of early microalbuminuria, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The Treatment Options for Type 2 Diabetes in Adolescents and Youth (TODAY) study was the first multiethnic, multicenter randomized trial in the United States to compare 3 treatment approaches in obese youth with new-onset type 2 diabetes (n=699; ages 10-17 years): monotherapy with metformin, metformin with rosiglitazone, and metformin with an intensive lifestyle intervention. The primary outcome was glycemic control. Diabetes-related complications and cardiovascular risk factors were also examined. Approximately half of the participants could not maintain glycemic control by using metformin alone. Combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone resulted in better durability of glycemic control, and metformin plus intensive lifestyle intervention was intermediate but not superior to metformin alone. Deterioration in glycemic control was associated with rapid loss of beta cell function, not worsened insulin sensitivity, and could not be explained by differences in adherence or body mass index. After 3.9 years, 236 (33.8%) of participants had hypertension and 116 participants (16.6%) had microalbuminuria. Only 55.9% of participants had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 100 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) after 3 years, and 71 of 517 participants (13.7%) had retinopathy. The significance of the findings from this important trial for the management of youth and young adults with youth-onset type 2 diabetes and its complications is discussed. An aggressive multifaceted approach is needed to prevent or forestall premature microvascular and macrovascular complications in youth-onset type 2 diabetes.",
"In holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum transmission areas, severe malaria primarily occurs in children aged <48 months and manifests as severe malarial anemia [SMA; hemoglobin (Hb) < 6.0 g/dL]. Induction of high levels of prostaglandin-E(2) (PGE(2)) through inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an important host-defense mechanism against invading pathogens. We have previously shown that COX-2-derived PGE(2) levels are reduced in children residing in hyperendemic transmission regions with cerebral malaria and in those with mixed sequelae of anemia and hyperparasitemia. Our in vitro studies further demonstrated that reduced PGE(2) was due to downregulation of COX-2 gene products following phagocytosis of malarial pigment (hemozoin, PfHz). However, as COX-2-PGE(2) pathways and the impact of naturally acquired PfHz on erythropoietic responses have not been determined in children with SMA, plasma and urinary bicyclo-PGE(2)/creatinine and leukocytic COX-2 transcripts were determined in parasitized children (<36 months) stratified into SMA (n = 36) and non-SMA (Hb â¥ 6.0 g/dL; n = 38). Children with SMA had significantly reduced plasma (P = 0.001) and urinary (P < 0.001) bicyclo-PGE(2)/creatinine and COX-2 transcripts (P = 0.007). There was a significant positive association between Hb and both plasma (r = 0.363, P = 0.002) and urinary (r = 0.500, P = 0.001)] bicyclo-PGE(2)/creatinine. Furthermore, decreased systemic bicyclo-PGE(2)/creatinine was associated with inefficient erythropoiesis (i.e., reticulocyte production index; RPI < 2.0, P = 0.026). Additional analyses demonstrated that plasma (P = 0.031) and urinary (P = 0.070) bicyclo-PGE(2)/creatinine and COX-2 transcripts (P = 0.026) progressively declined with increasing concentrations of naturally acquired PfHz by monocytes. Results presented here support a model in which reduced COX-2-derived PGE(2), driven in part by naturally acquired PfHz by monocytes, promotes decreased erythropoietic responses in children with SMA.",

"A series of 186 patients with blunt chest trauma was studied with transthoracic ultrasonography to diagnose pneumothorax and to evaluate its size and location. The results were compared with bedside chest radiography and spiral CT scan. The prevalence of pneumothorax on CT scan was 56/186 (30.1%). Pneumothorax was proven on radiography in 30/56 cases without false positive results: "radiographic deep sulcus sign" was evident in 3/29 cases, 26/29 cases being occult. The ultrasound study demonstrated the presence of pneumothorax in 55/56 patients: one occult pneumothorax was missed and no false positive results were observed. The CT scan differed of +/-2.3 cm (range 1-5 cm) from the US study in evaluating size and location of pneumothorax. In conclusion, ultrasound study may detect occult pneumothorax undiagnosed by standard plain radiography. It reflects accurately the extent of pneumothorax if compared with CT scan, outlining the "ultrasonographic deep sulcus sign" on anterior chest wall.",

"A multicenter, retrospective, observational study was conducted to determine prevalence, characteristics, management, and outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in Asian HIV-infected children in the TREAT Asia Pediatric HIV Observational Database (TApHOD). Data on PTB episodes diagnosed during the period between 12 months before antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation and December 31, 2009 were extracted. A total of 2678 HIV-infected children were included in TApHOD over a 13-year period; 457 developed PTB, giving a period prevalence of 17.1% (range 5.7-33.0% per country). There were a total of 484 PTB episodes; 27 children had 2 episodes each. There were 21 deaths (4.3%). One third of episodes (n=175/484) occurred after ART initiation at a median of 14.1 months (interquartile range [IQR] 2.5-28.8 months). The median (IQR) CD4+ values were 9.0% (3.0-16.0%) and 183.5 (37.8-525.0) cells/mm(3) when PTB was diagnosed. Most episodes (n=424/436, 97.3%) had abnormal radiographic findings compatible with PTB, whereas half (n=267/484, 55.2%) presented with clinical characteristics of PTB. One third of those tested (n=42/122, 34.4%) had bacteriological evidence of PTB. Of the 156 episodes (32.2%) that were accompanied with extrapulmonary TB, pleuritis was the most common manifestation (81.4%). After treatment completion, most episodes (n=396/484, 81.9%) were recorded as having positive outcomes (cured, treatment completed and child well, and improvement). The prevalence of PTB among Asian HIV-infected children in our cohort was high. Children with persistent immunosuppression remain vulnerable to PTB even after ART initiation.",

"Dietary fibre has been shown to have important health implications in the prevention of risks of chronic diseases. The objective of the present study was to determine the potential health benefits of legumes as a good source of dietary fibre. Six to ten local legumes were studied as follows: cowpeas, mung beans, pole sitao, chickpeas, green peas, groundnuts, pigeon peas, kidney beans, lima beans and soyabeans. The following studies were conducted: (a) mineral availability, in vitro; (b) glycaemic index (GI) in non-diabetic and diabetic human subjects; (c) the cholesterol-lowering effect in human subjects with moderately raised serum cholesterol levels. The highest Fe availability among legumes was for lima beans (9.5 (sem 0.1)) while for Zn and Ca, the highest availability was for kidney beans (49.3 (sem 4.5)) and pigeon peas (75.1 (sem 7.1)), respectively. Groundnuts have the lowest Fe (1.3 (sem 1.1)), Zn (7.9 (sem 1.3)) and Ca (14.6 (sem 2.8)) availability. Legumes are low-GI foods ( < 55), ranging from 6 (chickpeas) to 13 (mung beans). Kidney beans showed significant reductions for both total (6 %) and LDL-cholesterol (9 %), and groundnuts for total cholesterol (7 %; P < 0.05). We conclude that mineral availability from legumes differs and may be attributed to their mineral content, mineral-mineral interaction and from their phytic and tannic acid content; legumes are considered low-GI foods and have shown potential hypocholesterolaemic effects. The above studies can be a scientific basis for considering legumes as functional foods.",

"The aim of this study was to examine the early and late complications rate of central venous access ports connected to the Groshong catheter for long-term chemotherapy delivering. All patients suffering from a neoplastic disease, who required long-term chemotherapy and underwent insertion of implantable ports during a 21-month period (1 October 1994-30 June 1996) were prospectively studied. A single type of port was used, constructed of titanium and silicone rubber (Dome Port, Bard Inc., Salt Lake City, U.S.A), connected to an 8 F silastic Groshong catheter tubing (Bard Inc.). A team of different operators (two general surgeons, one interventional radiologist and four anaesthesiologists) was involved in inserting the port. All devices were placed in the operating room under fluoroscopic control. A central venous access form was filled in by the operator after the procedure and all ports were followed prospectively for device-related and overall complications. Data from the follow-up of these patients were entered in the form and collected in a database. Follow-up continued until the device was removed, the patient died or the study was closed. 178 devices, comprising a total of 32,089 days in situ, were placed in 175 patients. Three patients received a second device after removal of the first. Adequate follow-up was obtained in all cases (median 180 days, range 4-559). 138 devices (77.5%) were still in situ when the study was closed. Early complications included six pneumothoraxes, three arterial punctures and two revisions for port and/or catheter malfunction (overall early complications in 8 patients). Late complications included 3 cases (1.68% of devices) of catheter rupture and embolisation (0.093 episodes/1000 days of use), 2 cases (1.12% of devices) of venous thrombosis (0.062 episodes/1000 days of use), 1 case (0.56% of devices) of pocket infection (0.031 episodes/1000 days of use), and 4 cases (2.24% of devices) of port-related bacteraemias (0.124 episodes/1000 days of use). Infections were caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus (4 cases) and Bacillus subtilis (1 case); they required port removal in 3 out of 5 cases. This study represents the largest published series of patients with totally implantable access ports connected to Groshong catheters; this device is a good option for long-term access to central veins and delivery of chemotherapeutic regimens, including continuous intravenous infusions. The low incidence of major complications related to implantation and management of these devices support increased use in oncology patients.",

"The authors evaluated the effectiveness and safety of bimatoprost using an open-label, non-comparative, three-month, community-based surveillance study. Patients (n = 458) with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension received bimatoprost 0.03% ophthalmic solution as monotherapy, replacement therapy or adjunctive therapy. Bimatoprost produced a rapid, significant (p < 0.0001) reduction in intraocular pressure: monotherapy (34.6% reduction), replacement therapy (16.4% reduction); adjunctive therapy (24.1% reduction). Bimatoprost enabled more patients to achieve their pre-defined target intraocular pressure (p < 0.0001), compared to previous treatments, and significantly lowered intraocular pressure, regardless of the patients' baseline pressure level or history of pressure control. Bimatoprost was well-tolerated; the most commonly reported adverse event was conjunctival hyperaemia (19.9%). Most patients and ophthalmologists rated bimatoprost highly, compared to previously used treatments. The authors concluded that bimatoprost is an effective, well-tolerated treatment for lowering intraocular pressure in Thai patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.",
"This study was to extrapolate potential roles of augmented reality goggles as a clinical support tool assisting in the reduction of preventable causes of death on the battlefield. Our pilot study was designed to improve medic performance in accurately placing a large bore catheter to release tension pneumothorax (prehospital setting) while using augmented reality goggles. Thirty-four preclinical medical students recruited from Morehouse School of Medicine performed needle decompressions on human cadaver models after hearing a brief training lecture on tension pneumothorax management. Clinical vignettes identifying cadavers as having life-threatening tension pneumothoraces as a consequence of improvised explosive device attacks were used. Study group (n = 13) performed needle decompression using augmented reality goggles whereas the control group (n = 21) relied solely on memory from the lecture. The two groups were compared according to their ability to accurately complete the steps required to decompress a tension pneumothorax. The medical students using augmented reality goggle support were able to treat the tension pneumothorax on the human cadaver models more accurately than the students relying on their memory (p < 0.008). Although the augmented reality group required more time to complete the needle decompression intervention (p = 0.0684), this did not reach statistical significance.",

"The goal of this study was to determine whether aggressive heart rate (HR) control in patients with both chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) is associated with improved outcomes. HR control is one of the mainstays in management of patients with AF. However, rate control can be challenging in patients with HF. This study was designed as an interventional clinical trial, using patients with chronic AF and left ventricular systolic dysfunction with left ventricular ejection fraction â¤40% (n=20) as their own controls. Intervention consisted of increasing doses of metoprolol succinate to achieve target resting HR <70 beats per minute. Clinical data were collected at baseline and after intervention, with paired t test used to evaluate statistically significant change. After 3 months of intervention, average resting HR decreased from 94Â±14 beats per minute to 85Â±12 beats per minute. Average metoprolol succinate dose at the end of the study was 121 mg. None of the outcomes improved significantly after the intervention, including exercise tolerance (meters walked on 6-minute walk test 326Â±83 vs 330Â±86), quality of life (Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire score of 42.5Â±19 vs 38Â±21), and brain natriuretic peptide (242Â±306 pg/mL vs 279Â±395 pg/mL). Aggressive HR control was difficult in this group of patients with chronic AF and HF due to patient intolerance of increasing doses of Î²-blockade, and not associated with improved outcomes. Further studies are needed to establish guidelines for target HR in patients with chronic AF who also have significant HF.",
"Arterolane (RBx 11160) maleate is a novel, rapidly acting synthetic trioxolane antimalarial compound being developed by Ranbaxy Research Laboratories (Haryana, India). It is presently under phase III in combination with piperaquine phosphate. The present work reports the relationship between pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter (AUC(0-8h) on day 0/day 6) and indices of pharmacodynamic (PD) response (50% parasite clearance [PC(50)], 90% parasite clearance [PC(90)], parasite clearance time [PCT], recrudescence) from a phase II, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, dose-ranging trial. Patients with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were randomized to 1 of 3 arterolane maleate (50, 100, and 200 mg) doses for 7 consecutive days. Plasma concentration data were available from 78, 76, and 75 patients receiving a 50-, 100-, and 200-mg dose, respectively. Based on PD modeling, its limitations and assumptions, minimum 150-mg dose arterolane maleate was recommended to optimize the probability of maximum therapeutic benefits for an adult. Doses higher than 100 mg are unlikely to reduce the probability of recrudescence. This study re-stresses the need of combining short and long-acting drugs to prevent resistance development and minimize recrudescence.",

"Thai adult males (N = 85) with acute Plasmodium vivax malaria and normal glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase screening were randomized to receive 30 mg or 60 mg primaquine daily for 7 days (N = 43 and 42, respectively). The regimens were well tolerated and all patients recovered fully. Median fever clearance (47 hours; range 4 to 130 hours), mean + or - SD parasite clearance times (87.7 + or - 25.3 hours), gametocyte clearance, and adverse effects were similar in the 2 groups. Two patients, 1 from each group, had a 30% reduction in hematocrit. The cumulative 28 day relapse rate (95% confidence interval) by Kaplan Meier survival analysis was 29% (16-49%) in the 30 mg group compared with 7% (2-24%) in the 60 mg group; P = 0.027. Comparison with previous data obtained at this same site suggests that the recurrences comprised approximately 17% recrudescences and 12% relapses in the 30 mg/day group compared with 3% recrudescences and 4% relapses in the 60 mg/day group.

"Nitroglycerin (NTG), a NO donor, induces an attack in migraine patients approximately 4-6 h after administration. The causative mechanisms are not known, but the long delay leaves room for a central effect, such as a change in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission of various CNS areas involved in pain and behaviour including trigeminal nucleus caudalis and monoaminergic brain stem nuclei. To explore the central action of NTG, we have studied its effects on amplitude and habituation of the nociceptive blink reflex (nBR) and the visual evoked potential (VEP) before, 1 h and 4 h after administration of NTG (1.2 mg sublingual) or placebo (vehicle sublingual) in two groups of 10 healthy volunteers. We found a significant decrease in nBR pain and reflex thresholds both 1 and 4 h post-NTG. At the 4 h time point R2 latency was shorter (p=0.04) and R2 response area increased (p<0.01) after NTG but not after placebo. Habituation tended to become more pronounced after both NTG and placebo administration. There was a significant amplitude increase in the 5th VEP block (p=0.03) at 1h after NTG and in the 1st block (p=0.04) at 4 h. VEP habituation was replaced by potentiation at both delays after NTG; the change in habituation slope was significant at 1h (p=0.02). There were no significant VEP changes in subjects who received sublingual placebo. In conclusion, we found that in healthy subjects sublingual NTG, but not its vehicle, induces changes in a trigeminal nociceptive reflex and an evoked cortical response which are comparable to those found immediately before and during an attack of migraine. These changes could be relevant for the attack-triggering effect of NTG in migraineurs.",
"Blood pressure (BP) behavior during exercise is not clear in hypertensive patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The authors studied 57 men with newly diagnosed essential hypertension and untreated OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]Â â¥5) but without daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale scoreÂ â¤10), and an equal number of hypertensive controls without OSA matched for age, body mass index, and office systolic BP. All patients underwent ambulatory BP measurements, transthoracic echocardiography, and exercise treadmill testing according to the Bruce protocol. A hypertensive response to exercise (HRE) was defined as peak systolic BP â¥210Â mm Hg. Patients with OSA and control patients had similar ambulatory and resting BP, ejection fraction, and left ventricular mass. Peak systolic BP was significantly higher in patients with OSA (197.6Â±25.6Â mm Hg vs 187.8Â±23.6Â mm Hg; P=.03), while peak diastolic BP and heart rate did not differ between groups. Furthermore, an HRE was more prevalent in patients with OSA (44% vs 19%; P=.009). Multiple logistic regression revealed that an HRE is independently predicted by both the logAHI and minimum oxygen saturation during sleep (odds ratio, 3.94; confidence interval, 1.69-9.18; P=.001 and odds ratio, 0.94; confidence interval, 0.89-0.99; P=.02, respectively). Exaggerated BP response is more prevalent in nonsleepy hypertensives with OSA compared with their nonapneic counterparts. This finding may have distinct diagnostic and prognostic implications.",

"The adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IRBC) to receptors on different host cells plays a divergent yet critical role in determining the progression and outcome of the infection. Based on our ex vivo studies with clinical parasite isolates from adult Thai patients, we have previously proposed a paradigm for IRBC cytoadherence under physiological shear stress that consists of a recruitment cascade mediated largely by P-selectin, ICAM-1 and CD36 on primary human dermal microvascular endothelium (HDMEC). In addition, we detected post-adhesion signaling events involving Src family kinases and the adaptor protein p130CAS in endothelial cells that lead to CD36 clustering and cytoskeletal rearrangement which enhance the magnitude of the adhesive strength, allowing adherent IRBC to withstand shear stress of up to 20 dynes/cmÂ². In this study, we addressed whether CD36 supports IRBC adhesion as part of an assembly of membrane receptors. Using a combination of flow chamber assay, atomic force and confocal microscopy, we showed for the first time by loss- and gain-of function assays that in the resting state, the integrin Î±âÎ²â does not support adhesive interactions between IRBC and HDMEC. Upon IRBC adhesion to CD36, the integrin is recruited either passively as part of a molecular complex with CD36, or actively to the site of IRBC attachment through phosphorylation of Src family kinases, a process that is CaÂ²âº-dependent. Clustering of Î²1 integrin is associated with an increase in IRBC recruitment as well as in adhesive strength after attachment (â¼40% in both cases). The adhesion of IRBC to a multimolecular complex on the surface of endothelial cells could be of critical importance in enabling adherent IRBC to withstand the high shear stress in the microcirculations. Targeting integrins may provide a novel approach to decrease IRBC cytoadherence to microvascular endothelium.",
"It has been proposed that several neurohumoral factors may be involved in the genesis of vascular structural changes (remodeling or hypertrophy) frequently observed in essential hypertension. Therefore, in this study we investigated vascular structural alterations of subcutaneous small resistance arteries in patients with secondary forms of hypertension. The study included 70 participants: 11 with pheochromocytoma, 13 with primary aldosteronism, and 17 with renovascular hypertension; 13 normotensive subjects and 16 patients with essential hypertension served as controls. All subjects were submitted to a biopsy of subcutaneous fat. Small resistance arteries were dissected and mounted on a micromyograph, and media-lumen ratio, media thickness, remodeling index, and growth index were evaluated. Endothelial function was evaluated according to the dose-response curve to acetylcholine. In patients with either primary aldosteronism or renovascular hypertension, a marked increase in media-lumen ratio was observed, whereas in patients with pheochromocytoma, the extent of vascular structural alterations was similar to that observed in patients with essential hypertension. The increase in media-lumen ratio in patients with essential hypertension and with pheochromocytoma was mainly due to vascular remodeling (remodeling index, 93% to 94%), whereas in patients with renovascular hypertension, there was vascular growth (remodeling index, 70%; growth index, 53%). Patients with primary aldosteronism had an intermediate pattern compared with the other two forms of secondary hypertension. An evident impairment of endothelial function was observed in all four hypertensive groups.

"The Combination Therapy of Hypertension to Prevent Cardiovascular Events (COPE) trial compared the dihydropyridine T/L-type calcium channel blocker benidipine-based therapies when combined with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), a Î²-blocker (BB) or a thiazide diuretic (TD). The results suggested that benidipine combined with a BB appeared to be less beneficial in reducing the risk of stroke compared with the benidipine-TD combination (hazard ratio (HR): 2.31, P=0.0109). We further evaluated the treatment effects on different stroke subtypes among the three benidipine-based regimens. The COPE trial was an investigator-initiated, multicenter study with PROBE design. Patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter were excluded from the study. All stroke events were subclassified with the Trial of Org 10,172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) criteria. The total incidence of stroke was 4.7, hemorrhagic stroke was 1.6 and ischemic stroke was 2.5 per 1000 person-years. The incidence of lacunar stroke was 1.1, large-artery stroke was 0.6, cardioembolic stroke was 0.3, unknown ischemic type was 0.6 and transient ischemic attack was 0.6 per 1000 person-years. Although few differences in stroke subtypes were observed among the three treatment groups, multi-adjusted HRs for the incidence rates of all types of stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke were significantly higher with the benidipine-BB regimen than with the benidipine-TD regimen. The incidence of both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke in the benidipine-ARB regimen was not different compared with the other two treatment regimens. This prespecified sub-analysis suggested that a blood pressure-lowering therapy with a benidipine-TD regimen might be beneficial for hypertensive patients to prevent both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.",

"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased risk of stroke that can be attenuated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Vitamin K antagonist use is limited, in part, by the high incidence of complications when patients' international normalized ratios (INRs) deviate from the target range. The primary objective of ARISTOTLE is to determine if the factor Xa inhibitor, apixaban, is noninferior to warfarin at reducing the combined endpoint of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism in patients with AF and at least 1 additional risk factor for stroke. We have randomized 18,206 patients from over 1,000 centers in 40 countries. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive apixaban or warfarin using a double-blind, double-dummy design. International normalized ratios are monitored and warfarin (or placebo) is adjusted aiming for a target INR range of 2 to 3 using a blinded, encrypted point-of-care device. Minimum treatment is 12 months, and maximum expected exposure is 4 years. Time to accrual of at least 448 primary efficacy events will determine treatment duration. The key secondary objectives are to determine if apixaban is superior to warfarin for the combined endpoint of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism, and for all-cause death. These will be tested after the primary objective using a closed test procedure. The noninferiority boundary is 1.38; apixaban will be declared noninferior if the 95% CI excludes the possibility that the primary outcome rate with apixaban is >1.38 times higher than with warfarin. ARISTOTLE will determine whether apixaban is noninferior or superior to warfarin in preventing stroke and systemic embolism; whether apixaban has particular benefits in the warfarin-naÃ¯ve population; whether it reduces the combined rate of stroke, systemic embolism, and death; and whether it impacts bleeding.",
"We undertook a multi-institutional, retrospective study of 51 patients with adrenal tumors (pheochromocytomas, functioning and nonfunctioning cortical adenomas, cysts and carcinomas). All patients had computed tomography (CT) with a maximum of 5 millimeter cuts the week before undergoing complete adrenalectomy. Pathologists were asked to measure the tumor to the nearest 0.1 centimeter. Tumor size obtained from pathologic reports (actual size) and CT reports (estimated size) were compared. Adrenal tumors were divided into two groups on the basis of size--tumors with actual size of 6 centimeters or greater and tumors with actual size of less than 6 centimeters. Statistical analysis was performed with Newman-Keuls analysis of variance. After controlling for tumor type and for the institution at which the measurement was made, we found that CT consistently underestimated adrenal tumor size in both tumor groups. Moreover, the average, underestimated difference for tumors 6 centimeters or greater was 32 percent, but 47 percent for tumors less than 6 centimeters (p = 0.060). CT seemed to underestimate the size of small adrenal tumors more than large tumors. Because the decision to operate on solid, nonfunctioning adrenal tumors is based on tumor size and because CT is currently the standard technique used to estimate size, our findings need to be considered before undertaking surgical treatment.",
"Due to heightened risk for thromboembolic complications, nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) presents an absolute indication for long-term oral anticoagulation therapy. This was an observational, analytical, randomised, one-year clinical study, conducted in the Blood Transfusion Institute Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina. The aim of this study was to present the oral anticoagulation treatment in terms of International normalised ratio (INR) monitoring and warfarin/acenocoumarol dose titration in 117 patients with NVAF. INR values, the doses of warfarin and acenocoumarol, as well as the tendency and adequacy of their changes were monitored. Percentages of the therapeutic INR values were 51,77% and 53,62%, subtherapeutic 42,84% and 35,86%, and supratherapeutic 5,39% and 10,53% for the warfarin and acenocoumarol treatment, respectively. The average total weekly doses (TWD) which most frequently achieved the therapeutic INR values were 27,89+/-12,34 mg and 20,44+/-9,94 mg, for warfarin and acenocoumarol, respectively. The dose changes with the INR values 1,7 or lower/3,3 or higher were omitted in 13,46% and 15,63%, and with the INR values 1,8-3,2 were noted in 8,62% and 13,48% of all the check-up visits in the warfarin and acenocoumarol group, respectively. The annual dose changes were noted in 24,65% and 31,41%, and the daily dose changes in 74,43% and 73,36% of all the check-up visits of warfarin and acenocoumarol group, respectively. We can conclude that the management of the oral anticoagulation treatment in our country is in accordance with the relevant recommendations, but with the present tendency toward underdosing and unnecessary frequent dose changing.",

"Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is a new, highly effective, and well-tolerated combination treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. The lipophilic characteristic of piperaquine suggests that administration together with fat will increase the oral bioavailability of the drug, and this has been reported for healthy volunteers. This pharmacokinetic study monitored 30 adult patients with uncomplicated falciparum malaria for 4.5 months to evaluate the effects of the concomitant intake of fat on the total piperaquine exposure. The fixed-drug combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was given with water to fasting patients (n = 15) or was coadministered with 200 ml milk containing 6.4 g fat (n = 15). The drug combination was generally well tolerated, and there were no severe adverse effects reported for either group during the study. Total piperaquine exposure (area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity [AUC(0-â)]; results are given as medians [ranges]) were not statistically different between fed (29.5 h Â· Î¼g/ml [20.6 to 58.7 h Â· Î¼g/ml]) and fasting (23.9 h Â· Î¼g/ml [11.9 to 72.9 h Â· Î¼g/ml]) patients, but the interindividual variation was reduced in the fed group. Overall, none of the pharmacokinetic parameters differed statistically between the groups. Total piperaquine exposure correlated well with the day 7 concentrations in the fasted group, but the fed group showed a poor correlation. In conclusion, the coadministration of 6.4 g fat did not have any significant effect on piperaquine pharmacokinetics in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria.",
"The few reports that have been published on the current International Classification of Headache Disorders, Second Edition (ICHD-II), criteria for migralepsy and hemicrania epileptica have highlighted the considerable confusion regarding this "hot topic" within both headache and epilepsy classifications (ICHD-II and International League Against Epilepsy [ILAE]). Indeed, the ICHD-II describes a migraine-triggered seizure as a rare event in which a seizure occurs during migraine aura; on the other hand, hemicrania epileptica is described as an "ictal headache" that occurs "synchronously" with a partial seizure. To confuse matters even further, neither the term migralepsy nor the term hemicrania epileptica is included in the currently used ILAE classification. On the basis of both a review of "migralepsy" cases in the literature and 16 additional retrospective multicenter cases, we suggest that the term migraine-triggered seizure or migralepsy be deleted from the ICHD-II classification until unequivocal evidence is provided of its existence, and that the term ictal epileptic headache be introduced into the ILAE classification.",
"A consensus on what constitutes a clinically meaningful periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) remains highly debated. We evaluated the accuracy of 2 PMI definitions currently implemented for quality outcome assessment and clinical trial end points. Patients who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention with normal baseline troponin-I and creatine kinase-MB were included. PMI was defined according to either the 2007 Task Force (National Cardiovascular Database Registry [NCDR] CathPCI Registry) definition or the updated 2012 Task Force definition. Multivariate analysis was performed for the end point of 1-year all-cause death or myocardial infarction (MI). Of the 7,333 patients included, 31.9% and 2.1% were identified as having a PMI by NCDR or 2012 definition, respectively. Mean age was 66Â±11 years; 66.8% were men, 1.4Â±0.9 stents implanted per patient, 84.5% bivalirudin use, and 29.7 type C lesions. Death or MI occurred in 5.6% of NCDR and 6.6% of 2012 defined patients. Neither biomarker was independently associated with death or MI for either definition (NCDR odds ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.5, p=0.34; 2012 Task Force odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 3.0, p=0.38). Only a modest correlation exists for either definition to predict death or MI, which did not improve for the 2012 definition. In conclusion, PMI definitions currently used for catheterization lab quality metrics and those used for clinical trial end points have poor discrimination for adverse events. Although the 2012 definition drastically reduced the number of PMIs defined, it did not decrease the predictive accuracy over the NCDR definition.",

"Subjects with symptomatic, persistent/high-burden paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) were enrolled at 6 centers (n=86) and randomized to 1 of 2 arms. For group I, all CFAE regions with an interval confidence level >7 were ablated followed by pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). For group II, only CFAE sites with continuous electric activity were ablated followed by PVI. For PVI, all 4 PV antra were isolated with confirmed entrance block. Subjects were followed for 1 year with a visit, ECG, and 48-hour Holter every 3 months. Symptoms were confirmed by loop recording. The primary end point was freedom from arrhythmia >30 seconds at 1 year. For both group I and II, CFAE ablation prolonged AF cycle length (25Â±33 versus 23Â±33 ms; P=0.78) and resulted in similar rates of AF termination (37% versus 28%; P=0.42). Radiofrequency duration during CFAE ablation was significantly less in group II (23Â±20 versus 38Â±20 minutes; P=0.002). At 1-year follow-up, freedom from AF/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia recurrence was significantly higher in group I versus group II after 1 procedure (50% versus 28%; P=0.03). There were also significantly fewer repeat procedures in group I (13% versus 36%; P=0.021).",
"In an open-label, 24-month trial, 721 de novo heart transplant recipients were randomized to everolimus 1.5 mg or 3.0 mg with reduced-dose cyclosporine, or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 3 g/day with standard-dose cyclosporine (plus corticosteroids Â± induction). Primary efficacy endpoint was the 12-month composite incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection, acute rejection associated with hemodynamic compromise, graft loss/retransplant, death or loss to follow-up. Everolimus 1.5 mg was noninferior to MMF for this endpoint at month 12 (35.1% vs. 33.6%; difference 1.5% [97.5% CI: -7.5%, 10.6%]) and month 24. Mortality to month 3 was higher with everolimus 1.5 mg versus MMF in patients receiving rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) induction, mainly due to infection, but 24-month mortality was similar (everolimus 1.5 mg 10.6% [30/282], MMF 9.2% [25/271]). Everolimus 3.0 mg was terminated prematurely due to higher mortality. The mean (SD) 12-month increase in maximal intimal thickness was 0.03 (0.05) mm with everolimus 1.5 mg versus 0.07 (0.11) mm with MMF (p < 0.001). Everolimus 1.5 mg was inferior to MMF for renal function but comparable in patients achieving predefined reduced cyclosporine trough concentrations. Nonfatal serious adverse events were more frequent with everolimus 1.5 mg versus MMF. Everolimus 1.5 mg with reduced-dose cyclosporine offers similar efficacy to MMF with standard-dose cyclosporine and reduces intimal proliferation at 12 months in de novo heart transplant recipients.",
"We aimed to evaluate immunological, virological and clinical response to HAART, as well as all-cause mortality, in treatment-naive patients with a diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in the prior 6 months, compared to subjects with another AIDS-defining illness (ADI) or event-free individuals in an open, prospective and multicenter hospital-based cohort of HIV-infected naive adults (2004-2008). All cause mortality rates were calculated by Cox regression models. Among 4407 patients, 2400 (54.5%) started HAART: 110 (4.6%) had had previous TB and 414 (17.3%) another ADI. Median time from TB diagnosis to inititation of HAART was 53 days (IQR: 25.75-83.25), and for other ADI was 22 days (IQR: 8-42). Overall, 151 (6.3%) patients developed a new ADI during follow-up; 63% reached virological suppression and 69.4% had increases of â¥50 CD4+/Âµl, at 6 months. No statistically significant differences were found according to a previous history of TB or another ADI. Overall, 85 subjects died in 4031 person-years of follow-up with a mortality rate of 2.1 (95%CI: 1.7-2.6). When compared to subjects who started HAART in the absence of a previous ADI (HR 1), a prior diagnosis of an ADI other than TB was significantly associated with an increased risk of death. (HR 1.6; 95%CI: 1.1-2.3), but not a diagnosis of TB (HR 1.15; 95%CI: 0.5-2.5). In conclusion, a previous diagnosis of TB or another ADI before HAART did not compromise short-term virological and immunological response to treatment. A prior diagnosis of an ADI different to TB significantly increased all cause mortality.",

"Migraine, particularly migraine with aura, and increased body weight are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The association of weight change and clinical markers of CVD risk was evaluated in subjects participating in a randomized double-blind, parallel-group study of migraine-preventive treatment comparing 100 mg/day of topiramate and amitriptyline. Individuals from both treatment groups were pooled and stratified into three groups. The 'major weight gain' group gained > or = 5% of their baseline body weight at the conclusion of the study; the 'major weight loss' group lost > or = 5% of their baseline body weight. The third group had < 5% of weight change. The influence of weight change in headache outcomes, as well as in markers of CVD (blood pressure, cholesterol, C-reactive protein), was assessed using analysis of covariance. Of 331 subjects, 52 (16%) experienced major weight gain and 56 (17%) experienced major weight loss. Weight change was not associated with differential efficacy for the treatment of headache. However, contrasted with those with major weight loss, those who gained weight experienced elevations in mean diastolic blood pressure (+2.5 vs. -1.2 mmHg), heart rate (+7.6 vs. -1.3 beats per minute), glycosylated haemoglobin (+0.09% vs. -0.04%), total cholesterol (+6.4 vs. -6.3 mg/dl), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (+7.0 vs. -4.4 mg/dl) and triglycerides (+15.3 vs. -10.4 mg/dl) and an increase in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (+1.8 vs. -1.9 mg/l). Both groups experienced decreases in systolic blood pressure (-4.0 vs. -1.3 mmHg) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-3.7 vs. -0.8 mg/dl). Increased weight during migraine treatment is not associated with poor headache treatment outcomes, but is associated with deterioration of CVD risk markers.",

Among pooled population (nÂ = 1,399 patients), 1,173 patients with follow-up angiography were divided into 3 stent length categories (â¤20, 20 to 40, and >40Â mm). There was no statistical significance of in-stent restenosis (ISR) in â¤20- and 20- to 40-mm categories between 2 groups. However, ISR rate was significantly reduced in triple versus dual group in >40-mm stent length category (12.4% vs 22.1%, pÂ = 0.008). In diabetic patients, triple group also showed significant reduction in the ISR rate in >40-mm stent length category (15.4% vs 32.3%, pÂ = 0.003). According to postprocedural minimal lumen diameter, triple group showed a trend toward a lower ISR than that of the dual group in all categories (pÂ = 0.033 for â¤2.5Â mm, pÂ = 0.087 for 2.5 to 3.0Â mm, and pÂ = 0.119 for >3.0Â mm). In conclusion, the triple group had a significantly reduced ISR in patients with >40-mm stent length after DES implantation compared with the dual group. Therefore, this suggestion for use of triple antiplatelet therapy could be easily applied after DES implantation in routine clinical practice.",

Multivariate random effects analysis showed trends during follow-up (increased levels of hemoglobin, platelets and lymphocytes, and decreased levels of leukocytes and neutrophils) and identified explanatory variables.

"This open-label randomized trial compared isoniazid (9 months) to rifampin (4 months) on toxicity and completion in a jailed population with latent tuberculosis infection.

Completion was achieved for 33% receiving rifampin compared to 26% receiving isoniazid (p = .10). With careful monitoring rifampin is a safe and less toxic regimen and appears to be a reasonable alternative because of its shorter duration, allowing more people to complete treatment behind bars. Therapy completion in released inmates is unacceptably low and ensuring follow-up after discharge must be part of a decision to treat.",

"Artemether-lumefantrine and nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) are the most commonly recommended first-line treatments for malaria and HIV, respectively, in Africa. Artemether, lumefantrine, and nevirapine are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system, which nevirapine induces, creating potential for important drug interactions. In a parallel-design pharmacokinetic study, concentration-time profiles were obtained in two groups of HIV-infected patients: ART-naÃ¯ve patients and those stable on nevirapine-based therapy. Both groups received the recommended artemether-lumefantrine dose. Patients were admitted for intense pharmacokinetic sampling (0 to 72 h) with outpatient sampling until 21 days. Concentrations of lumefantrine, artemether, dihydroartemisinin, and nevirapine were determined by validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. The primary outcome was observed day 7 lumefantrine concentrations, as these are associated with therapeutic response in malaria. We enrolled 36 patients (32 females). Median (range) day 7 lumefantrine concentrations were 622 ng/ml (185 to 2,040 ng/ml) and 336 ng/ml (29 to 934 ng/ml) in the nevirapine and ART-naÃ¯ve groups, respectively (P = 0.0002). The median artemether area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h [AUC((0-8 h))] (P < 0.0001) and dihydroartemisinin AUC((60-68 h)) (P = 0.01) were lower in the nevirapine group. Combined artemether and dihydroartemisinin exposure decreased over time only in the nevirapine group (geometric mean ratio [GMR], 0.76 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.65 to 0.90]; P < 0.0001) and increased with the weight-adjusted artemether dose (GMR, 2.12 [95% CI, 1.31 to 3.45]; P = 0.002). Adverse events were similar between groups, with no difference in electrocardiographic Fridericia corrected QT and P-R intervals at the expected time of maximum lumefantrine concentration (T(max)). Nevirapine-based ART decreased artemether and dihydroartemisinin AUCs but unexpectedly increased lumefantrine exposure. The mechanism of the lumefantrine interaction remains to be elucidated. Studies investigating the interaction of nevirapine and artemether-lumefantrine in HIV-infected patients with malaria are urgently needed.",
"The parasympathetic signalling molecules acetylcholine, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide-38 (PACAP38) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) may be released from parasympathetic fibres and activate sensory nerve fibres during migraine attacks. Recently, it was shown that VIP does not induce migraine-like attacks in migraine patients. Interestingly, PACAP38 activates the same VPAC receptors as VIP, but also specifically activates the PAC1 receptor. The present thesis includes four double-blind placebo-controlled crossover studies aimed to explore the role of acetylcholine, PACAP and VIP in migraine and head pain. In study I-III we investigated acetylcholine, via the analogue carbachol, and PACAP38 in a human model of migraine. In study IV we studied if PACAP38 and VIP might induce central sensitization, neurogenic inflammation and mast cell degranulation in a cutaneous model of acute pain. Study I-II showed that carbachol induced short lasting mild headache and moderate cephalic vasodilatation in both healthy volunteers and migraine patients, but did not induce migraine-like attacks. In study III PACAP38 induced headache in healthy subjects and delayed migraine-like attacks in migraine patients as well as sustained dilatation of cephalic vessels. In study IV VIP and PACAP38 evoked skin pain, central sensitization, neurogenic inflammation and mast cell degranulation, but VIP showed to be more potent than PACAP38 in inducing neurogenic inflammation and mast cell degranulation. In conclusion, we found that carbachol infusion was not a good model for experimental migraine provocation, probably because the maximal dose was insufficient to produce enough nitric oxide to trigger migraine. PACAP38 infusion is a new pathway for migraine induction and the results from study IV suggest that neurogenic inflammation and mast cell degranulation are unlikely to cause PACAP38 induced migraine. The present thesis contributes to our knowledge on migraine pathophysiology and suggests PAC1 receptor antagonism as a new target for migraine treatment.",
"In order to mitigate the effect of non-stationarity in frequency domain analysis of data, we propose a modification to the power spectral estimation, a widely used technique to characterize physiological signals. Spectral analysis requires partitioning data into smaller epochs determined by the desired frequency resolution. The modified approach proposed here involves dividing the data within each epoch by the standard deviation of the data for that epoch. We applied this modified approach to cardiac beat-to-beat interval data recorded from a newborn infant undergoing hypothermia treatment for birth asphyxia. The critically ill infant had episodes of tachyarrhythmia, distributed sporadically throughout the study, which affected the stationarity of the heart rate. Over the period of continuous heart rate recording, the infant's clinical course deteriorated progressively culminating in death. Coinciding with this clinical deterioration, the heart rate signal showed striking changes in both low-frequency and high-frequency power indicating significant impairment of the autonomic nervous system. The standard spectral approach failed to capture these phenomena because of the non-stationarity of the signal. Conversely, the modified approach proposed here captured the deteriorating physiology of the infant clearly.",

"1. As an ancillary study carried out during the recently completed Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea, we examined the effect of hydroxyurea on the body weight, body composition and exercise capacity of adult patients with sickle-cell anaemia. 2. The subjects received either hydroxyurea (six males and four females) or placebo (eight males and six females). Data for each subject were generated during four separate 24 h admissions to the General Clinical Research Center. These admissions occurred at baseline and then at 6, 12 and 18 months after the start of study drug (hydroxyurea or placebo) administration. During each admission, body composition was measured by using a dual X-ray absorptiometer, and exercise testing was performed by cycle ergometry. Anaerobic performance was assessed according to a 'Wingate' protocol (20 s at maximal intensity against a cycling resistance of 7.5% body weight). Aerobic performance was examined using a steady state submaximal exercise protocol (10 min cycling time). 3. At baseline, no significant difference in any parameter was found between the hydroxyurea- and placebo-treated groups. At 18 months, the hydroxyurea-treated subjects exhibited an average weight gain of 3.16 kg. The mean weight gain in the placebo-treated subjects was 1.82 kg. Body composition analysis showed that the additional weight in both groups involved both lean and fat body mass components. In anaerobic performance, the subjects given hydroxyurea showed an increase in peak muscle power of 104.9 W. The placebo group also showed an increase, but theirs was a more modest gain of 57.7 W. The most marked improvement in anaerobic performance was observed in the hydroxyurea-treated men (P < 0.05). In aerobic performance, the hydroxyurea-treated subjects exhibited a decrease in peak heart rate response to a standardized workload of 15.2 beats/min, as compared with a decrease of only 4.3 beats/min in the placebo-treated patients. 4. Taken together, the overall weight gain, combined with increases in both anaerobic muscular performance and aerobic cardiovascular efficiency, provides objective data to support the subjective impression that hydroxyurea administration produces an improvement in the physical capacity of patients with sickle-cell anaemia.",

"Painful crises in patients with sickle cell anemia are caused by vaso-occlusion and infarction. Occlusion of blood vessels depends on (at least) their diameter, the deformability of red cells, and the adhesion of blood cells to endothelium. Deoxygenated sickle cells are rigid because they contain linear polymers of hemoglobin S (Hb S); polymerization is highly concentration dependent, and dilution of Hb S by a nonsickling hemoglobin such as fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) would be expected to lead ultimately to a decrease in the frequency of painful crises. It might also be expected to decrease the severity of anemia, although the pathogenesis of anemia in sickle cell anemia (SS disease) is not clearly understood. Reversion to production of fetal rather than adult hemoglobin became practical with the discovery that HU was an orally effective and relatively safe "switching agent." Preliminary dose-ranging studies led to a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial, the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH), designed to test whether patients treated with HU would have fewer crises than patients treated with placebo. The MSH was not designed to assess the mechanism(s) by which a beneficial effect might be achieved, but it was hoped that observations made during the study might illuminate that question. The 2 MSH treatment groups were similar to each other and were representative of African-American patients with relatively severe disease. The trial was closed earlier than expected, after demonstration that median crisis rate was reduced by almost 50% (2.5 versus 4.5 crises per year) in patients assigned to HU therapy. Hospitalizations, episodes of chest syndrome, and numbers of transfusions were also lower in patients treated with HU. Eight patients died during the trial, and treatment was stopped in 53. There were no instances of alarming toxicity. Patients varied widely in their maximum tolerated doses, but it was not clear that all were taking their prescribed treatments. When crisis frequency was compared with various clinical and laboratory measurements, pretreatment crisis rate and treatment with HU were clearly related to crisis rate during treatment. Pretreatment laboratory measurements were not associated with crisis rates during the study in either treatment group. It was not clear that clinical improvement was associated with an increase in Hb F. Crisis rates of the 2 treatment groups became different within 3 months. Mean corpuscular volumes (MCVs) and the proportion of Hb F containing red cells (F cells) rose, and neutrophil and reticulocyte counts fell, within 7 weeks. When patients were compared on the basis of 2-year crisis rates, those with lower crisis rates had higher F-cell counts and MCVs and lower neutrophil counts. Neutrophil, monocyte, reticulocyte, and platelet counts were directly associated, and F cells and MCV were inversely associated, with crisis rates in 3-month periods. In multivariable analyses, there was strong evidence of independent association of lower neutrophil counts with lower crisis rates. F-cell counts were associated with crisis rate only in the first 3 months of treatment; MCV showed an association over longer periods of time. Overall, the evidence that decreased neutrophil counts played a role in reducing crisis rates was strong. Increased F cells or MCV and evidence of cytoreduction by HU were also associated with decreased crisis rates, but no definitive statement can be made regarding the mechanism of action of HU because the study was not designed to address that question. Future studies should be designed to explore the mechanism of action of HU, to identify the optimal dosage regimen, and to study the effect of HU when combined with other antisickling agents.",

"To test the hypothesis that microvascular obstruction to blood flow at the level of the arteriole may be significant in individuals with sickle cell anemia, the ophthalmologic effects of orally administered nifedipine were monitored in 11 steady-state patients. Three patients with evidence of acute peripheral retinal arteriolar occlusion displayed a prompt reperfusion of the involved segment. Two other patients showed fading of retroequatorial red retinal lesions. Color vision performance was improved in six of the nine patients tested. The majority of patients also demonstrated a significant decrease in the amount of blanching of the conjunctiva which reflects improved blood flow to this frequently involved area. Such improvements were not observable in a control group of untreated stable sickle cell subjects. These findings support the hypothesis that inappropriate vasoconstriction or frank vasospasm may be a significant factor in the pathogenesis of the microvascular lesions of sickle cell disease and, further, that selective microvascular entrapment inhibition may offer an additional strategy to the management of this disorder. We believe a larger, placebo-controlled study with nifedipine and similar agents is warranted.",
"Inflammatory response and hemodilution are the main drawbacks of extracorporeal circulation. We hypothesize that the use of miniaturized extracorporeal circulation (MECC) might lower the systemic and myocardial inflammatory patterns compared with a standard system (SECC) and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG). Sixty-one patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft were prospectively randomized to MECC (n = 19), SECC (n = 20), or OPCABG (n = 22). Blood samples were collected from radial artery and coronary sinus to analyze blood lactate, hemodilution, and markers for inflammation and endothelial activation such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and E-selectin. No differences were observed in early clinical outcome. Interleukin -6 levels increased in every group during and after cardiac surgery, whereas TNF-Î± values grew in the SECC group (p = 0.05). E-selectin systemic values decreased during and after operation (p = 0.001) in every group. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 systemic and cardiac levels raised only in SECC group (p = 0.014). In conclusion, MECC is comparable to SECC and OPCABG in the clinical outcome of low-risk patients, and it might be extensively used with no additional intraoperative risk. The analysis of the inflammatory patterns of endothelial activation shows MECC as effective as OPCABG, suggesting further studies to clarify MECC recommendation in high-risk patients.",
"Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy in the form of high-energy shock (HES) is associated with adverse effects. This study evaluated an alternative therapy to HES, including antitachycardia pacing (ATP) for very fast ventricular tachycardia (VFVT) and low-energy shock (LES) â¤5 J for ventricular tachycardia (VT) of any cycle length (CL). This multicenter study recruited 602 patients with standard indications for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Programming was standardized into 3 zones: (1) ventricular fibrillation (VF) CL of <200 ms treated with HES; (2) VFVT defined within the VF zone (CL, 200 to 250 ms) treated with 2 ATP bursts, LES, and HES; and (3) fast ventricular tachycardia (CL, 251 to 320 ms) and slow VT (CL, >320 ms) treated with 3 ATP bursts, LES, and HES. The primary end point was ATP and LES efficacy and safety. After a mean follow-up of 19 Â± 8 months, 2,815 device activations were recorded in 152 patients. Of 67 VFVT episodes, 34 reverted with combined ATP and LES (success rate 50.7%) with first and second ATPs successful in 36% and 13.8%, respectively. LES was used in 39 fast ventricular tachycardia and 60 slow VT episodes with success rates of 53.8% and 73.3%, respectively. Syncope occurred in 19.4%, 16.2%, and 1% of episodes because of VFVT, VF, and VT CL >250 ms, respectively. In conclusion, tiered ATP and LES therapy terminates >50% of VFVT episodes (CL, 200 to 250 ms), which otherwise would fall within the VF zone and be treated exclusively with HES. LES is efficacious and safe in patients with VTÂ CL >250 ms with extremely low syncope rates. Limitation of ATP to a single burst in VFVT is recommended to minimize syncope.",

"The Metabolic Efficiency With Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 36 (MERLIN-TIMI 36) trial randomized 6560 patients hospitalized with a non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome to ranolazine or placebo in addition to standard therapy. Continuous ECG recording was performed for the first 7 days after randomization and evaluated in a blinded core laboratory. SCD (n=121) was assessed over a median follow-up of 1 year. A total of 6345 patients (97%) had continuous ECG recordings evaluable for analysis. Compared with patients with no VT (n=2764), there was no increased risk of SCD in patients with only ventricular triplets (n=1978, 31.2%) (1.4% versus 1.2%); however, the risk of SCD was significantly greater in patients with VT lasting 4 to 7 beats (n=1172, 18.5%) (SCD, 2.9%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.3; P<0.001) and in patients with VT lasting at least 8 beats (n=431, 6.8%) (SCD, 4.3%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.8; P=0.001). This effect was independent of baseline characteristics and ejection fraction. VT occurring within the first 48 hours after admission was not associated with SCD.",

"To investigate changes in preoperative clinical features and the long-term outcome of tumor recurrence, mortality, and morbidity in patients with pheochromocytoma, we retrospectively examined changes in the clinical features by comparing 49 patients from 1957 to 1985 (group I) with 46 patients from 1986 to December 1995 (group II). In addition in these 95 patients (excluding 2 who had died before operation), we evaluated long-term postoperative outcome from the initial operation to August 1996 (909 patient-years). The mean age in group II was older than that of group I. The percentage of patients having proteinuria or hypertensive retinopathy in group II was less than that in group I. Of 20 patients with incidentally discovered pheochromocytoma, 7 (35%) were > or =60 years old, 7 asymptomatic, and 11 (55%) normotensive. Plasma and urinary catecholamines in these patients were significantly (P < .01) lower than in patients with pheochromocytoma having typical clinical features. Long-term cohort study showed 14 deaths. Relative survival rates were 91% at 5 years and 83% at 10 years and unchanged thereafter. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of pheochromocytoma-free survival was shorter in patients with a larger-than-median (60 g) tumor weight. Six patients had malignant recurrence 3 to 101 months (median, 45 months) after the initial operation. Of 65 patients confirmed alive at follow-up, 11 were hypertensive. In the Cox model, hypertension-free survival was not associated with age, a family history of hypertension, duration of hypertension, or creatinine clearance. Pheochromocytoma should be diagnosed from a wide spectrum of clinical features including those that are not generally suspected of resulting from excess catecholamines or hypertension, and after surgery, patients with this disease should be followed-up carefully for a long period (at least 10 years) because of the risk of tumor recurrence and the high prevalence of disease.",

"The aim of this study was to evaluate our results during and after the Nuss operation in children with pectus excavatum. We have performed the Nuss procedure in 128 patients with pectus excavatum since 2001, and 74 patients underwent bar removal. Of the 128 patients 96 were male and 32 were female; age ranged from eight to 21 years with an average of 13.8 years. In 46% of patients psychological reasons for operative treatment were dominant while in the other 54% of patients clinical signs were the indications. Complications in 128 patients included 36 pneumothorax, 28 of which resolved spontaneously. Postoperative pneumonia developed in six patients. In two patients we had infection of the implanted bar, and there were two patients with cellulitis. We had six patients with bar displacement and reoperation was needed. During the Nuss procedure we had one injury of the intercostal artery. We had pericardial tears in two patients without clinical significance. In two patients we had pericardial effusion six months after the Nuss procedure, requiring pericardiocentesis. In one patient we had fracture of the sternum. There were no complications following bar removal. After bar removal in 74 patients, 54 patients (72.9%) maintained excellent results with normal chest anatomy, good results were found in 16 patients (21.6%) with mild residual pectus and poor results in four patients (5.5%) with severe recurrence. Our experience with the Nuss procedure demonstrated excellent results with few minor complications.",

"There is substantial evidence that the autonomic system plays an important part in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). It appears that, although some patients have a preponderantly sympathetic or vagal overactivation leading to AF, a combined sympathovagal drive is most commonly responsible for AF triggering. The purpose of this hypothesis-generating study was to test whether moxonidine, a centrally acting sympathoinhibitory agent, on top of optimal antihypertensive treatment, can lead to a decrease in AF burden in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF. This was a prospective, double-blind, 1-group, crossover study. Hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF sequentially received treatment with placebo and moxonidine for two 6-week periods, respectively. The change in AF burden (measured as minutes of AF per day in three 48-hour Holter recordings) between the 2 treatment periods was the primary outcome measure. Fifty-six patients (median age 63.5 years, 35 men) were included. During moxonidine treatment, AF burden was reduced from 28.0 min/day (interquartile range [IQR] 15.0 to 57.8) to 16.5 min/day (IQR 4.0 to 36.3; p <0.01). European Heart Rhythm Association symptom severity class decreased from a median of 2.0 (IQR 1.0 to 2.0) to 1.0 (IQR 1.0 to 2.0; p = 0.01). Systolic blood pressure levels were similar in the 2 treatment periods, whereas diastolic blood pressure was lower (p <0.01) during moxonidine treatment. The most frequent complaint was dry mouth (28.6%). No serious adverse events were recorded. In conclusion, treatment with moxonidine, a centrally acting sympathoinhibitory agent, results in reduction of AF burden and alleviation of AF-related symptoms in hypertensive patients with paroxysmal AF.",

"Data from the Prolonged Migraine Prevention (PROMPT) with Topiramate trial were evaluated post hoc to determine whether topiramate could prevent migraine auras, and whether its efficacy in preventing migraine headaches was similar in patients with (MA; n = 269) and without (MoA; n = 542) aura. Migraines and auras were recorded during prospective baseline, 6-month open-label (OL) topiramate and 6-month double-blind (DB), placebo-controlled phases. In the last 28 OL days, migraines without aura and migraine auras decreased by 43.1% and 54.1%, respectively, in MA patients. MoA patients experienced a 44.3% reduction in migraines. In the DB phase, increases in migraines with placebo vs. topiramate were similar to the full study, but were generally not statistically significant, probably due to lack of power in the subgroup analysis. Similarly, there were no statistically significant changes in number of auras between groups. Thus, topiramate appears to reduce migraine auras in parallel with headache reductions, which are similar in patients with and without aura.",

"Glycosylation is the most abundant post-translational polypeptide chain modification in nature. Although carbohydrate modification of protein antigens from many microbial pathogens constitutes important components of B cell epitopes, the role in T cell immunity is not completely understood. Here, using ELISPOT and polychromatic flow cytometry, we show that O-mannosylation of the adhesin, Apa, of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is crucial for its T cell antigenicity in humans and mice after infection. However, subunit vaccination with both mannosylated and non-mannosylated Apa induced a comparable magnitude and quality of T cell response and imparted similar levels of protection against Mtb challenge in mice. Both forms equally improved waning BCG vaccine-induced protection in elderly mice after subunit boosting. Thus, O-mannosylation of Apa is required for antigenicity but appears to be dispensable for its immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice. These results have implications for the development of subunit vaccines using post-translationally modified proteins such as glycoproteins against infectious diseases like tuberculosis.",

"The human electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of XEN-D0101 were evaluated to assess its usefulness for treating atrial fibrillation (AF). XEN-D0101 inhibited Kv1.5 with an IC50 of 241 nM and is selective over non-target cardiac ion channels (IC50 Kv4.3, 4.2 Î¼M; hERG, 13 Î¼M; activated Nav1.5, >100 Î¼M; inactivated Nav1.5, 34 Î¼M; Kir3.1/3.4, 17 Î¼M; Kir2.1, >>100 Î¼M). In atrial myocytes from patients in sinus rhythm (SR) and chronic AF, XEN-D0101 inhibited non-inactivating outward currents (Ilate) with IC50 of 410 and 280 nM, respectively, and peak outward currents (Ipeak) with IC50 of 806 and 240 nM, respectively. Whereas Ilate is mainly composed of IKur, Ipeak consists of IKur and Ito. Therefore, the effects on Ito alone were estimated from a double-pulse protocol where IKur was inactivated (3.5 ÂµM IC50 in SR and 1 ÂµM in AF). Thus, inhibition of Ipeak is because of IKur reduction and not Ito. XEN-D0101 significantly prolonged the atrial action potential duration at 20%, 50%, and 90% of repolarization (AF tissue only) and significantly elevated the atrial action potential plateau phase and increased contractility (SR and AF tissues) while having no effect on human ventricular action potentials. In healthy volunteers, XEN-D0101 did not significantly increase baseline- and placebo-adjusted QTc up to a maximum oral dose of 300 mg. XEN-D0101 is a Kv1.5/IKur inhibitor with an attractive atrial-selective profile.",

"Transitioning from the inpatient to outpatient setting is often a problematic aspect of diabetes mellitus (DM) care. Different factors during hospitalization may adversely affect glycemic control in patients, who are frequently discharged on regimens that differ markedly from prehospitalization outpatient regimens. Moreover, the discharge recommendations may not have been tested adequately during a relatively short hospital length of stay and pose a significant threat to patient safety upon discharge. Our pilot study evaluated the effect on hospital utilization of the transitional care clinic (TCC), where patients with DM are seen within 2 to 5 days of hospital discharge. One hundred patients with DM, who were either medically indigent (no insurance or Medicaid and no primary care providers) or covered by Medicaid, and who did not have a primary care provider, were randomized into either a control or an intervention group upon discharge from the hospital. Subjects from the intervention group (n = 50) were seen in the TCC. All subjects were contacted 90 days after discharge to collect information about emergency department visits and readmissions. Thirteen subjects from the control group and 13 from the intervention group visited the emergency department within 90 days of discharge. Fourteen control subjects (28%) and 10 intervention patients (20%) were rehospitalized for various medical conditions during the follow-up period (P = not significant). Among patients originally admitted for DM-related issues, 6 of 14 in the control group (42.9%) and 2 out of 16 in the intervention group (12.5%) were readmitted during follow-up (P < 0.05). We conclude that the TCC may be effective for the prevention of rehospitalizations in indigent patients admitted for DM-related problems and who did not have primary care providers. The benefit of the TCC was not seen when patients with DM were admitted for other medical problems. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm this preliminary finding.",

The selection of clopidogrel was most commonly less preferable, both initially (69.7%) and at discharge (75.6%). Appropriate selection of newer agents was high initially (79.2%-82.8%), with further increase as selection at discharge (89.4%-89.8%). Inappropriate selection of the newer agents was 17.2%-20.8% initially, decreasing to 10.2%-10.6% at discharge. Conditions and co-medications related to increased bleeding risk, presentation with ST elevation myocardial infarction and the absence of reperfusion within the first 24h were the most powerful predictors of appropriate P2Y12 selection initially, whereas age â¥75 years, conditions and co-medications related to increased bleeding risk and regional trends mostly affected appropriate P2Y12 selection at discharge.",

"Patients with chronic headache and medication overuse are particularly difficult to treat, with no one approach being universally accepted. Some type of withdrawal program, however, is typically implemented before beginning a pharmacological prophylaxis treatment. Different withdrawal modalities have been performed for managing these patients: at first step, in-patient withdrawal has been confirmed effective in preceding clinical experiences. In recent years, new modalities for withdrawal have been developed as day-hospital setting. Purpose of this study was to determine the clinical course of a sample of chronic migraine patients with medication overuse 3 years after day-hospital withdrawal. A group of 202 patients were treated. Patients were suffering from chronic migraine with medication overuse according with IHS criteria. All patients were submitted to a day-hospital withdrawal and then they were followed with meetings every 3 months until the first year and then every 6 months until the last follow-up 3 years after withdrawal. Eighty patients achieved the last follow-up meeting 3 years after withdrawal. Patients clinically improved, significantly, both for days of headache per month and consumption of medications per month. From these results, the day-hospital setting for withdrawal, followed by periodic clinical meetings, seems to be effective for this category of patients to improve significantly at long-term headache frequency and analgesics intake.",

"New-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) is a serious complication after kidney transplantation, but therapeutic strategies remain underexplored. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors selectively foster insulin secretion without inducing hypoglycemia, which might be advantageous in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with NODAT. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial to assess safety and efficacy of the DPP-4 inhibitor vildagliptin. Intraindividual differences in oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-derived 2-h plasma glucose (2HPG) from baseline to 3 months after treatment served as primary endpoint. Among secondary outcomes, we evaluated HbA1c, metabolic and safety parameters, as well as OGTTs at 1 month after drug discontinuation. Of 509 stable KTRs who were screened in our outpatient clinic, 63 (12.4%) had 2HPG â¥ 200 mg/dL, 33 of them were randomized and 32 completed the study. In the vildagliptin group 2HPG and HbA1c were profoundly reduced in comparison to placebo (vildagliptin: 2HPG = 182.7 mg/dL, HbA1c = 6.1%; placebo: 2HPG = 231.2 mg/dL, HbA1c = 6.5%; both p â¤ 0.05), and statistical significance was achieved for the primary endpoint (vildagliptin: 2HPG-difference -73.7 Â± 51.3 mg/dL; placebo: -5.7 Â± 41.4 mg/dL; p < 0.01). Adverse events were generally mild and occurred at similar rates in both groups. In conclusion, DPP-4 inhibition in KTRs with overt NODAT was safe and efficient, providing a novel treatment alternative for this specific form of diabetes.",

"The objective of this study was to evaluate patients' satisfaction with acute treatment of migraine with frovatriptan or almotriptan by preference questionnaire. One hundred and thirty three subjects with a history of migraine with or without aura (IHS 2004 criteria), with at least one migraine attack in the preceding 6Â months, were enrolled and randomized to frovatriptan 2.5Â mg or almotriptan 12.5Â mg, treating 1-3 attacks. The study had a multicenter, randomized, double blind, cross-over design, with treatment periods lasting <3Â months. At study end patients assigned preference to one of the treatments using a questionnaire with a score from 0 to 5 (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints were pain free and pain relief episodes at 2 and 4Â h, and recurrent and sustained pain free episodes within 48Â h. Of the 133 patients (86%, intention-to-treat population) 114 of them expressed a preference for a triptan. The average preference score was not significantly different between frovatriptan (3.1Â Â±Â 1.3) and almotriptan (3.4Â Â±Â 1.3). The rates of pain free (30% frovatriptan vs. 32% almotriptan) and pain relief (54% vs. 56%) episodes at 2Â h did not significantly differ between treatments. This was the case also at 4Â h (pain free: 56% vs. 59%; pain relief: 75% vs. 72%). Recurrent episodes were significantly (PÂ <Â 0.05) less frequent under frovatriptan (30% vs. 44%), also for the attacks treated within 30Â min. No significant differences were observed in sustained pain free episodes (21% vs. 18%). The tolerability profile was similar between the two drugs. In conclusion, our study suggests that frovatriptan has a similar efficacy of almotriptan in the short-term, while some advantages are observed during long-term treatment.",

"Biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) has been used in patients for almost a decade; There is a wealth of knowledge from clinical trials to document its efficacy and safety and suggest that BIAsp 30 is an option for initiation and intensification of insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The A1chieve was a non-interventional study that explored the safety and effectiveness of initiating or switching to insulin analogues in routine clinical practice in more than 60,000 patients from 28 different countries. In this manuscript, we discuss the findings from the subgroup of the Indian cohort who were treated with BIAsp 30. In a cohort of 15287 who were on BIAsp 30, 12645 (83%) were insulin naive and 2642 (17%) had been on insulin therapy earlier. Glycaemic parameters were high at baseline. Mean (SD) HbA1c was 9.2% (1.3) in the these and was comparable in the insulin naive and insulin experienced groups. After 24 weeks of therapy with BIAsp 30, there were reductions in HbA1c in both the insulin naive group, [-1.8 (1.3)] and insulin experienced group [-1.6 (1.3)]. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels were also reduced significantly from baseline [-3.4 (2.7) and -4.8 (3.8) mmol/L, respectively, p < 0.05). Overall, hypoglycaemia decreased from 1.33 events/patient years at baseline to 0.19 events/patient years at 24 weeks. There was also an increase in quality of life score as evaluated by EQ-5D questionnaire. Initiating insulin therapy with or switching to BIAsp 30 in patients with poor glycaemic control leads to an improvement in glycaemic profile with no major hypoglycaemia or clinically significant weight gain. Therapy with BIAsp 30 also improves the quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

"Background Although previous clinical trials demonstrated the non-inferiority of a rate control to rhythm control strategy for management of atrial fibrillation (AF), the optimal treatment strategy for paroxysmal AF (PAF) remains unclear. Methods and Results A randomized, multicenter comparison of rate control vs rhythm control in Japanese patients with PAF (the Japanese Rhythm Management Trial for Atrial Fibrillation (J-RHYTHM) study) was conducted. The primary endpoint was a composite of total mortality, symptomatic cerebral infarction, systemic embolism, major bleeding, hospitalization for heart failure, or physical/psychological disability requiring alteration of treatment strategy. In the study, 823 patients with PAF were followed for a mean period of 578 days. The primary endpoint occurred in 64 patients (15.3%) assigned to rhythm control and in 89 patients (22.0%) to rate control (P=0.0128). No significant differences between the treatment strategies were observed in the incidences of death, stroke, bleeding and heart failure. Meanwhile, significantly fewer patients requested changes of assigned treatment strategy in the rhythm control vs the rate control group, which was accompanied by improvement in AF-specific quality of life scores. Conclusion The J-RHYTHM study showed that rhythm control was associated with fewer primary endpoints than rate control. However, mortality and cardiovascular morbidity were not affected by the treatment strategy (umin-CTR No. C000000106).",

"The effects of dietary n-3 fatty acids (n-3FAs) on the frequency of pain episodes and ex vivo blood tests of thrombosis have been evaluated in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) utilizing a double-blind, olive oil-controlled clinical trial. Dietary n-3FA therapy (0.1 g/kg/d) was provided as menhaden fish oil (0.25 g/kg/d) containing 12% eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 18% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Within 1 month dietary n-3FAs exchanged with n-6FAs in plasma and erythrocyte membrane phospholipids (p <0.01 in all cases). Treatment with dietary n-3FAs for 1 year reduced the frequency of pain episodes requiring presentation to the hospital from 7.8 events during the preceding year to 3.8 events/year (p <0.01; n = 5). By contrast, subjects receiving control dietary olive oil (n = 5) experienced 7.1 pain events/year, compared to 7.6 during the previous year (p >0.4). The reduction in episodes in n-3FA-treated subjects was also significant when compared to control subjects (p <0.01). Dietary n-3FA therapy was not associated with hemorrhagic, gastrointestinal or other adverse effects. Compared to 10 asymptomatic African-American controls, sickle cell subjects demonstrated significantly increased pretreatment: 1) flow cytometric expression of platelet membrane P-selectin (CD62p; p <0.01) and annexin V binding sites (p = 0.02); 2) plasma levels of platelet-specific secretory proteins platelet factor 4 (PF4) and beta-thromboglobulin (betaTG) (p <0.01 in both cases); 3) plasma products of thrombin generation, prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F1.2) and thrombin:antithrombin (TAT) complex (p <0.01 in both cases); and 4) plasma levels of thrombolytic products, D-dimer and plasmin:antiplasmin (PAP) complex (p <0.01 in both cases). Treatment with dietary n-3FAs concurrently decreased plasma levels of F1.2, D-dimer, and PAP (p <0.05, compared to olive oil controls), implying that the reduction in pain events was related to n-3FA-dependent inhibition of thrombosis. We conclude that dietary n-3FAs reduce the frequency of pain episodes perhaps by reducing prothrombotic activity in sickle cell disease.",

In this open label randomized pilot study the effects of oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on phosphatidylserine (PS) expression as marker of cellular oxidative damage (primary end point), and markers of hemolysis, coagulation and endothelial activation and NAC tolerability (secondary end points) were studied. Eleven consecutive patients (ten homozygous [HbSS] sickle cell patients, one HbSÎ²(0)-thalassemia patient) were randomly assigned to treatment with either 1,200 or 2,400 mg NAC daily during 6 weeks. The data indicate an increment in whole blood glutathione levels and a decrease in erythrocyte outer membrane phosphatidylserine exposure, plasma levels of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and cell-free hemoglobin after 6 weeks of NAC treatment in both dose groups. One patient did not tolerate the 2,400 mg dose and continued with the 1,200 mg dose. During the study period, none of the patients experienced painful crises or other significant SCD or NAC related complications. These data indicate that N-acetylcysteine treatment of sickle cell patients may reduce SCD related oxidative stress.",

"At least 50 % of female migraineurs experience migraine associated with the perimenstrual period, even though they may also suffer from attacks at other times of the cycle (menstrually related migraine, MRM). MRM attacks tend to be longer and more intense than those arising in other phases of the menstrual cycle, and are often aggravated by more pronounced vegetative phenomena. In this open preliminary trial, we tested the efficacy of associating frovatriptan and dexketoprofen for the treatment of an acute attack of MRM, diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Headache Society, in 24 patients between 19 and 45 years of age (mean 31.33 Â± 7.33). Twenty-one of them completed the study. Pain relief was achieved by 76 % of patients at 2 h and by 86 % at 4 h.

A pain-free state at 24 h was present in 76 % of MRM sufferers, 33 % of whom showed a sustained pain-free state at 24 h. A rescue medication was needed by eight patients. While decidedly encouraging, the data of this study obviously need confirmation with double blind studies involving a greater number of patients.",
"Cellular responses to Plasmodium falciparum parasites, in particular interferon-gamma (IFNÎ³) production, play an important role in anti-malarial immunity. However, clinical immunity to malaria develops slowly amongst naturally exposed populations, the dynamics of cellular responses in relation to exposure are difficult to study and data about the persistence of such responses are controversial. Here we assess the longevity and composition of cellular immune responses following experimental malaria infection in human volunteers. We conducted a longitudinal study of cellular immunological responses to sporozoites (PfSpz) and asexual blood-stage (PfRBC) malaria parasites in naÃ¯ve human volunteers undergoing single (nâ=â5) or multiple (nâ=â10) experimental P. falciparum infections under highly controlled conditions. IFNÎ³ and interleukin-2 (IL-2) responses following in vitro re-stimulation were measured by flow-cytometry prior to, during and more than one year post infection. We show that cellular responses to both PfSpz and PfRBC are induced and remain almost undiminished up to 14 months after even a single malaria episode. Remarkably, not only 'adaptive' but also 'innate' lymphocyte subsets contribute to the increased IFNÎ³ response, including Î±Î²T cells, Î³Î´T cells and NK cells. Furthermore, results from depletion and autologous recombination experiments of lymphocyte subsets suggest that immunological memory for PfRBC is carried within both the Î±Î²T cells and Î³Î´T compartments. Indeed, the majority of cytokine producing T lymphocytes express an CD45RO(+) CD62L(-) effector memory (EM) phenotype both early and late post infection. Finally, we demonstrate that malaria infection induces and maintains polyfunctional (IFNÎ³(+)IL-2(+)) EM responses against both PfRBC and PfSpz, previously found to be associated with protection. These data demonstrate that cellular responses can be readily induced and are long-lived following infection with P. falciparum, with a persisting contribution by not only adaptive but also (semi-)innate lymphocyte subsets. The implications hereof are positive for malaria vaccine development, but focus attention on those factors potentially inhibiting such responses in the field.",

"The initiation of a prophylactic treatment in a migraine sufferer depends upon the stratification of the patient's frequency of attacks and the disability they cause, as well as the patient's acute consumption and comorbid diseases. We report on 14 patients who were among a group of 618 migraine sufferers who received a new preventative treatment. These 14 patients developed an increase in the frequency of their migraine attacks that was possibly induced by this new prophylactic treatment. The clinical description of the migraine attacks remained the same but the frequency of the attacks of migraine without aura was dramatically increased. This is, to our knowledge, the first description of a possible precipitation of attacks of migraine without aura with a prophylactic treatment. There is no link with a specific class of prophylactic treatment. We hypothesize that the migraine sufferers who experienced aggravation after the new prophylactic drug had been introduced had a paradoxical decrease in the induction threshold for cortical spreading depression (CSD). Mechanisms of such a decrease are unknown and are probably multifactorial, but changes in serotonin neurotransmission have been experimentally demonstrated to modify cortical excitability and favour CSD. The aggravation was described only for attacks without aura. However, with only 14 patients, it is not possible to predict whether suffering from that the type of migraine is a factor that predisposes a patient to aggravation. While additional cases are necessary, physicians should be aware of the possibility that prophylactic treatment may exacerbate migraine attacks.",
"Experimental and pilot clinical trials suggest the role of melatoninergic systems in the pathogenesis of migraine and the treatment effect of drugs acting on melatonin receptors.

Twenty patients with migraine, aged from 23 to 45 years, were treated with agomelatin in dose 25 mg per day during 3 months. The frequency of migraine attacks decreased from 7.4Â±2.4 to 3.8Â±1.4 (p=0.025), the duration and intensity of attacks decreased from 38.0Â±14.10 h to 24.0Â±6.1 h (p=0.018). The increase of treatment efficacy index, the decrease of headache impact on the general state measured with the VAS (from 8.1Â±1.8 to 7.2Â±1.6; p=0.01) and quality of life (HIT-6 index) as well as the duration of disability caused by headache (HALT index) were seen. The reduction of depression severity and normalization of night sleep were found in patients treated with agomelatin.",

"Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), is still one of the most serious threats to TB control worldwide. Early diagnosis of MDR-TB is important for effectively blocking transmission and establishing an effective protocol for chemotherapy. Genechip is a rapid diagnostic method based on molecular biology that overcomes the poor biosafety, time consumption, and other drawbacks of traditional drug sensitivity testing (DST) that can detect MDR-TB. However, the Genechip approach has not been effectively evaluated, especially in limited-resource laboratories. In this study, we evaluated the performance of Genechip for MDR-TB in 1,814 patients in four prefectural or municipal laboratories and compared its performance with that of traditional DST. The results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of Genechip were 87.56% and 97.95% for rifampin resistance and 80.34% and 95.82% for isoniazid resistance, respectively. In addition, we found that the positive grade of the sputum smears influenced the judgment of results by Genechip. The test judged only 75% of the specimens of "scanty" positive grade. However, the positive grade of the specimens showed no influence on the accuracy of Genechip. Overall, the study suggests that, in limited-resource laboratories, Genechip showed high sensitivity and specificity for rifampin and isoniazid resistance, making it a more effective, rapid, safe, and cost-beneficial method worthy of broader use in limited-resource laboratories in China.",

"Methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta, a continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA), is reported to be effective in managing renal anemia but there is little data about CERA in Japan. This study aimed to ascertain the effects of CERA in Japanese hemodialysis patients and the appropriate starting dose of CERA when switching from other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. We switched 61 stable hemodialysis patients to 4-weekly intravenous CERA, from either epoetin beta (rHuEPO) or darbepoetin alpha (DA). When determining the initial dose of CERA, we used guidelines recommended by the Japanese supplier for switching from rHuEPO, but for DA we based the CERA dose on European reports, because no Japanese guidelines exist. Fifty-two patients completed the 28-week study. Hemoglobin was maintained within the target range (10.0-12.0âg/dL). The required CERA dose decreased over the 28 weeks. The hemoglobin level and CERA dose stabilized faster when switching from DA. CERA showed similar efficacy in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The effect of CERA is similar regardless of whether patients switch from low- or high-dose erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. In conclusion, CERA is effective for Japanese hemodialysis patients at a lower dose than expected.",

"Antituberculosis properties of methyldioxotetrahydropyrimidine sulfonisonicotinoyl hydrazide (MSH) registered in Russia under the name of tubosan of the class of immunotropic agents were investigated with the use of 78 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT). In concentration of 60 or 80 mcg/ml the drug showed significant antituberculosis activity. The effect of MSH on drug susceptible MBT was bactericidal. The effect of MSH on the drug resistant MBT (with the isoniazid MIC of 1 mcg/ml) was bactericidal in 75% of the cases and bacteriostatic in 25% of the cases. With the use of MBT resistant to isoniazid in a concentration of 10 mcg/ml the antituberculosis effect was observed in 47% of the cases. The complex treatment of 102 patients with destructive forms of tuberculosis in a daily dose of 800-1200 mg for 2-5 months provided significant clinicoroentgenologic positive dynamics of the process in 75% of the patients. The destructive cavities closed up in 30% of the patients and reduction of the destruction dimentions up to 0.5-2 cm was stated in 45% of the patients. In the control group of 40 patients insignificant dynamics of the destructive processes was observed only in 40% of the patients. Satisfactory tolerability of the drug was registered. The immunity status parameters improved with increase of the total number of T-lymphocytes and phagocytosis indices. The study showed that MSH was efficient in complex therapy of tuberculosis patients allow for increased number of cases with drug resistant tuberculosis.",

"Spontaneous pneumothorax is a common disease and as many as 20% of these patients should be operated because of a recurrent pneumothorax, persistent air leak, or failure to completely reexpand the lung. From January 1993 until March 1994, on the basis of experiment, we performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) intervention and talc pleurodesis on 8 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax caused by ruptured bullae, and designed a new procedure of occluding the bullae with interruptured titanium clips. This procedure has some advantages of complete occlusion of lung tissue at the base of the bulla, minimal loss of lung tissue, effectively preventing leakage and recurrent pneumothoraces, and enough capacity of anti-tension while the lung expands. Also Authors have advocated giving a negative pressure suction to opsilateral lumen of the Carlen's tube interbation to visualize adequately the intrathoracic structures, while selective lung ventilation is performed. This method keeps hemodynamic stability and is performed more easily and safely than that of positive pressure insufflation is done. Postoperatively, complete lung expansion was obtained in all patients. There were no perioperative complications related to VATS, and no recurrences to date. These early results with thoracoscopic management of spontaneous pneumothorax caused by ruptured bullae have encouraging.",

"Studies of frailty among patients on hemodialysis have relied on definitions that substitute self-reported functioning for measures of physical performance and omit weight loss or substitute alternate criteria. We examined the association between body composition and a definition of frailty that includes measured physical performance and weight loss in a cross-sectional analysis of 638 adult patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis at 14 centers. Frailty was defined as having three of following characteristics: weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow gait speed. We performed logistic regression with body mass index (BMI) and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS)-derived estimates of intracellular water (ICW), fat mass, and extracellular water (ECW) as the main predictors, and age, sex, race, and comorbidity as covariates. Overall, 30% of participants were frail. Older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.31 per 10 years; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.14 to 1.50), diabetes (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.40), higher fat mass (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.37), and higher ECW (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.47) associated with higher odds of frailty. Higher ICW associated with lower odds of frailty (OR, 0.80 per kg; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.87). The addition of BMI data did not change the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC; AUC=0.66 versus 0.66; P=0.71), but the addition of BIS data did change the AUC (AUC=0.72; P<0.001). Thus, individual components of body composition but not BMI associate strongly with frailty in this cohort of patients receiving hemodialysis.",

"The present study sought to determine the extent to which adverse angiographic events encountered during percutaneous coronary intervention for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Patients with STEMI represent a cohort at particularly high risk of intraprocedural thrombotic events (IPTEs). The overall frequency and implications of IPTEs occurring in patients with STEMI have not been systematically quantified in previous studies. A total of 3,163 patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention with stent implantation for STEMI in the Harmonizing Outcomes with RevasculariZatiON and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial underwent detailed frame-by-frame core laboratory angiographic analysis to assess IPTEs. The clinical outcomes at 30 days were compared between the patients with and without IPTEs. IPTEs, defined as the development of new or increasing thrombus, abrupt vessel closure, no reflow, slow reflow, and distal embolization at any point during the procedure, occurred in 386 patients (12.2%). The independent predictors of IPTE were thrombus at baseline, lesion length, and randomization to bivalirudin; the patients with IPTEs were also more likely to receive bailout glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and unplanned thrombectomy. Compared with patients without IPTEs, the patients with IPTEs had higher 30-day rates of composite major adverse cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, ischemic target vessel revascularization, and stroke; 7.8% vs 4.2%, p = 0.002), major bleeding not related to coronary artery bypass grafting (11.8% vs 6.5%, p <0.001), and all-cause death (4.2% vs 1.8%, p = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, IPTEs were independently associated with 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events, major bleeding, and death. In conclusion, the development of IPTEs in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI was associated with subsequent adverse outcomes, including major adverse cardiovascular events, major bleeding, and death. Additional studies of strategies to decrease the occurrence of IPTEs are warranted.",

"Erythrocytes from sickle cell anaemia (SCA) patients continuously produce larger amounts of pro-oxidants than normal cells. Oxidative stress seems to primarily affect the membrane and results in haemolysis. The use of antioxidants in vitro reduces the generation of pro-oxidants. To evaluate the impact of vitamins C (VitC) and E (VitE) supplementation in SCA patients, patients over 18 years were randomly assigned to receive VitC 1400 mg + VitE 800 mg per day or placebo orally for 180 d. Eighty-three patients were enrolled (44 vitamins, 39 placebo), median age 27 (18-68) years, 64% female. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding clinical complications or baseline laboratorial tests. Sixty percent of the patients were VitC deficient, 70% were VitE deficient. Supplementation significantly increased serum VitC and E. However, no significant changes in haemoglobin levels were observed, and, unexpectedly, there was a significant increase in haemolytic markers with vitamin supplementation. In conclusion, VitC + VitE supplementation did not improve anaemia and, surprisingly, increased markers of haemolysis in patients with SCA and S-Î²(0) -thalassaemia. The exact mechanisms to explain this findings and their clinical significance remain to be determined.",

"The purpose of our entomological survey was to estimate mosquito biodiversity, infectivity rates and insecticide resistance levels in Anopheles species in four study sites in a mining area with high malaria transmission in southeastern Guinea. Anopheles gambiae s.l. (77%) was the most common Anopheles collected followed by An. funestus (20%). The specimens of the An. gambiae complex were predominantly An. gambiae S form (97.6%) with 1.4% of An. gambiae M form found in KÃ©rouanÃ© only, and 1% of An. arabiensis which was present in all four study sites. Anopheles gambiae S form and An. funestus were found to be infected with Plasmodium falciparum, with infectivity rates of 4.1% and 4.4% and inoculation rates of 0.60 and 0.19 infected bite/person/night, respectively. In addition, a high level (79%) of the knockdown resistance (kdr) L1014F mutation was reported in the populations of An. gambiae S form. The high malaria transmission that occurs in the prospected area of Guinea requires a long-term vector control programme. However, such a control programme will have to consider the presence of the kdr gene at a surprisingly high level within the dominant vector, which could reduce the expected impact of vector control.",

"Recent trials have favoured ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation (AF) management, however the present study investigated whether the restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm with long-term anticoagulation therapy was superior in terms of embolic events and death in 534 patients with an AF duration > 48 h. Patients were randomized and received sinus rhythm control with either aspirin (group 1) or warfarin (group 2), or they were given ventricular rate control (group 3). Cardioversion to sinus rhythm was attempted in 425 patients and was successful in 387 (91.1%) of them. After 3 years' follow-up there were 12, two and 15 embolic events in groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively (significant difference between groups 1 and 2, and 2 and 3) and overall mortalities were four, two and 12, respectively (significant difference between groups 2 and 3). It is concluded that patients with an AF duration > 48 h might benefit considerably from sinus rhythm restoration and long-term warfarin therapy in terms of embolic events and mortality.",
"Former Soviet Union countries including the Baltic States (Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia) are hot spots for an emerging epidemic of drug resistant tuberculosis (TB). As a part of the development of a co-ordinated network of centers for diagnostic trials across Eastern Europe we conducted a retrospective multicenter analysis of the performance of the GenoTypeÂ® MTBDRPlus assay for TB identification and susceptibility to isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) in routine settings. A total of 1,045 primary samples, 1045Â TB cultures derived from these specimens and 306 separate M. tuberculosis isolates tested in 2007-2010 at four participating sites (Tartu, Estonia; Riga, Latvia; Vilnius, Lithuania; and Samara, Russian Federation) were included in the analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity values for RIF and INH were 95.3% and 95.5%, 89.9 and 87.1%, respectively; there were no statistically significant variations in performance across sites. The proportion of multidrug resistant (MDR) strains in the collections ranged from 21.8% (in Estonia) to 55.9% (in Russia). In a routine non-trial context, the assay reliably detected both rifampicin and isoniazid resistance. The absence of statistically significant differences between sites suggested that the comparable performance obtained using these assays has helped demonstrate the formation of a successful diagnostic trial network.",

"We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of a website designed to improve compliance to treatment protocols in adolescents with type-1 diabetes. Fifty-nine adolescents, 13-18 years of age, were randomly assigned to a control or experimental group. The control group received standard medical care as usual. The experimental group participated in an interactive, 7-week web-based intervention, taking part in problem-solving through discussion forums, chat rooms and blogs. Fifty of the 59 participants (85%) completed measures assessing diabetes-related quality of life, self-efficacy and outcome expectations. These variables were expected to be interrelated and their combined effects were considered as mediators of compliance. There was a marginally significant difference between the two groups on these combined measures (Pâ=â0.052), with the control group scoring significantly higher on Positive Outcome Expectations (Pâ=â0.03) both pre- and post-treatment.

"Slight elevations in cardiac troponin I and T are frequently observed after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a complex syndrome induced by exposure to intravascular contrast media (CM). Currently, the relationships between the CM, pre-existing kidney insufficiency, CI-AKI, and myonecrosis after elective PCI are unclear. To investigate the relationship between CI-AKI and post-procedural myonecrosis (PMN) after PCI, we analyzed 327 non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome subjects undertaking elective PCI. The levels of cardiac troponins (cTns), cTnI and cTnT, at baseline and on at least one occasion 18-24 h after PCI were measured. We also recorded serum levels of creatinine (SCr) and the urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) before coronary angiography, and 24-48 h and 48-72 h after contrast administration. A post-procedure increase in cTns was detected in 16.21% (53/327) of subjects with cTns levels >99th to 5Ã99th percentile upper reference limit (URL). Twenty-seven patients (8.26%) developed CI-AKI. CI-AKI occurred more often in subjects with PMN than in those without PMN (20.8% versus 5.8%, respectively, P=0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that pre-existing microalbuminuria (MA) was an important independent predictor of PMN (OR: 3.31; 95% CI: 1.26-8.65, P=0.01). However, there was no correlation between the incidence of CI-AKI and PMN (OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 0.88-6.46, P=0.09). We conclude that pre-existing MA was not only an important independent predictor of CI-AKI but also of PMN.",

"This study evaluated the effect of telmisartan, ramipril, and amlodipine on atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence and severity in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. A total of 391 hypertensive outpatients with metabolic syndrome, in sinus rhythm but with at least 2 episodes of AF in the previous 6 months were randomized to telmisartan, ramipril, or amlodipine for 1 year. At the first AF, ventricular rate (VR) and plasma cardiac troponin I (TnI) were evaluated. P-wave dispersion (PWD) and procollagen type I carboxy-terminal peptide (PIP) were evaluated before and after 12 months of treatment. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were similarly and significantly reduced by all treatments (P < .001). In all, 49% of patients treated with amlodipine had a recurrence of AF as did 25.5% of patients with ramipril and 12.9% of patients with telmisartan (P < .01 vs amlodipine and P < .05 vs ramipril). Ventricular rate and TnI at the first AF recurrence were significantly lower with telmisartan and ramipril than with amlodipine. P-wave dispersion was reduced by ramipril (-5.1 ms, P < .05) and even more by telmisartan (-11 ms, P < .01). Telmisartan and ramipril induced a similar PIP reduction (-52.8 and -49.8 Âµg/L, respectively, P < .01). These findings suggested that in these patients telmisartan was more effective than ramipril in reducing AF recurrence and severity as well as in improving PWD, despite a similar BP reduction and a similar improvement in cardiac fibrosis. This could be related to a specific effect of telmisartan on atrial electric remodeling.",

"The objective of this prospective cohort study was to describe real-life use of lipid-lowering drugs and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target-attainment rates 1 year after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). LDL-C was recorded at hospital admission for AMI and at follow-up at 2 and 12 months after AMI in 17,236 patients in the Swedish heart registry, SWEDEHEART, from 2004 through 2009. Lipid-lowering treatments were identified using the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. More than 90% of patients received statins after AMI. Simvastatin â¤40 mg was used by 80% of patients at discharge and at 2 months and 68% at 1 year after AMI. Intensive statin therapy (LDL-C-lowering capacity >40%) was prescribed for 8.4%, 11.9%, and 12.2% at these time points, and combinations of statin/ezetimibe for 1.1%, 2.8%, and 5.0%, respectively. The LDL-C target of <2.5 mmol/L (97 mg/dl) was achieved in 74.5% of patients at 2 months and 72.3% at 12 months after AMI. Treatment was intensified for only 21.3% of patients with LDL-C above target at 2 months. In multivariate analysis, higher LDL-C levels at admission and at 2 months correlated to increased risk for under treatment at 12 months after AMI. In conclusion, statin treatment after AMI in Sweden has become standard, but titration to reach recommended LDL-C levels is still suboptimal. Strategies to further improve implementation of guidelines are needed.",

In the poor/no use HTR subgroup, more patients receiving telcagepant 300 mg (56/98, 57.1%) had 2-hour pain relief than those receiving zolmitriptan (44/111, 39.6%; odds ratio = 2.11 [95% CI: 1.20,3.71], P = .009); the percentage for telcagepant 150 mg (57/119, 47.9%) was not significantly different from zolmitriptan (odds ratio = 1.41 [95% CI: 0.82, 2.40], P = .211).",

"Right ventricular (RV) infarction is associated with increased mortality. Functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) may complicate inferoposterior infarction with RV involvement leading to pulmonary hypertension and increased RV afterload, potentially exacerbating RV remodeling and dysfunction. We studied 179 patients with inferior wall left ventricular (LV) ST-elevation myocardial infarction and RV infarction. The presence and severity of FMR and RV function were assessed by echocardiography. FMR was diagnosed based on echocardiographic criteria and when the severity of regurgitation was â¥moderate. Eighteen patients (10.0%) had â¥moderate FMR. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was higher in patients with FMR than in patients without FMR (43 Â± 10 vs 34 Â± 10 mmHg, respectively, pÂ = 0.002). RV systolic dysfunction was present in 76 patients (42.5%). FMR was a strong predictor of RV dysfunction (odds ratio 5.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.65 to 17.48, pÂ = 0.005) independent of reperfusion therapy. During a median follow-up of 4.1Â years, 20 (12.4%) and 10 (55.6%) deaths occurred in patients with and without FMR, respectively (p <0.001). In a multivariable Cox regression model, compared with patients without FMR and with normal RV function, the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 1.02 in patients without FMR and with RV dysfunction (95% CI 0.39 to 2.69, pÂ = 0.97) and 3.62 in patients with FMR with RV dysfunction (95% CI 1.33 to 9.85, pÂ = 0.01). In conclusion, in patients with RV infarction, the development of concomitant hemodynamically significant FMR is associated with RV dysfunction. The risk for mortality is increased predominantly in patients with both RV dysfunction and FMR.",
"Statins are among the most widely used drugs in the management of hypercholesterolemia. In addition to inhibiting endogenous cholesterol synthesis, however, statins decrease coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) synthesis. CoQ10 has been reported to have antioxidant properties, and administration of drugs that decrease CoQ10 synthesis might lead to increased oxidative stress in vivo. Our present study examined the hypothesis that atorvastatin increased oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic patients due to its inhibition of CoQ10 synthesis. We investigated the effects of atorvastatin (10 mg/d) administration for 5 months on lowering hypercholesterolemia and blood antioxidant status. The study population included 19 hypercholesterolemic outpatients. Blood levels of lipid and antioxidant markers, consisting of vitamin C, vitamin E, CoQ10, and glutathione (GSH), and urinary levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were examined pre- and postadministration of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin administration resulted in a significant decrease in blood levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, vitamin E, and CoQ10 (P < .05); however, a significant increase in the ratios of vitamin E/LDL cholesterol and CoQ10/LDL cholesterol was noted (P < .05). Atorvastatin had no significant effect on red blood cell (RBC) level of GSH and urinary 8-OHdG. The present study provides evidence that atorvastatin exerts a hypocholesterolemic effect, but on the basis of the urinary level of 8-OHdG and the blood ratios of vitamin E/LDL cholesterol and CoQ10/LDL cholesterol, has no oxidative stress-inducing effect.",

"Telcagepant is a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist being evaluated for acute migraine treatment. CGRP is a potent vasodilator that is elevated after myocardial infarction, and it delays ischemia during treadmill exercise. We tested the hypothesis that CGRP receptor antagonism does not reduce treadmill exercise time (TET). The effects of supratherapeutic doses of telcagepant on TET were assessed in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period, crossover study in patients with stable angina and reproducible exercise-induced angina. Patients received telcagepant (600 mg, n = 46; and 900 mg, n = 14) or placebo and performed treadmill exercise at T(max) (2.5 h after the dose). The hypothesis that telcagepant does not reduce TET was supported if the lower bound of the two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the mean treatment difference (telcagepant-placebo) in TET was more than -60 s. There were no significant between-treatment differences in TET (mean treatment difference: -6.90 (90% CI: -17.66, 3.86) seconds), maximum exercise heart rate, or time to 1-mm ST-segment depression using pooled data or with stratification for dose.",

"Thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention can result in improved rates of normal epicardial flow and myocardial perfusion, but several unmet needs remain. The purpose of the Delivery of thrombolytIcs before thrombectomy in patientS with ST-segment elevatiOn myocardiaL infarction Undergoing primary percuTaneous coronary interventION (DISSOLUTION) trial was to evaluate the hypothesis that local delivery of thrombolytics can enhance the efficacy of thrombus aspiration in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention. A total of 102 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and angiographic evidence of massive thrombosis in the culprit artery were randomly assigned to receive a local, intrathrombus bolus of 200,000 U of urokinase (n = 51) or saline solution (n = 51) by way of an infusion microcatheter, followed by manual aspiration thrombectomy. The end points included the final Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade and frame count, myocardial blush grade, 60-minute ST-segment resolution >70%, and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, defined as the death, reinfarction, stroke, or clinically driven target vessel revascularization at 6 months. The use of intrathrombus urokinase was associated with a significantly higher incidence of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3 (90% vs 66%, p = 0.008) and lower postpercutaneous coronary intervention Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction frame count (19 Â± 15 vs 25 Â± 17, p = 0.033). The postprocedural myocardial perfusion was significantly increased with the use of urokinase (myocardial blush grade 2 or 3, 68% vs 45%, p = 0.028), with more patients showing ST-segment resolution >70% (82% vs 55%, p = 0.006). At 6 months of follow-up, the patients treated with intrathrombus urokinase showed a better major adverse cardiac event-free survival (6% vs 21%; log-rank p = 0.044). In conclusion, local, intrathrombus delivery of thrombolytics before manual thrombectomy improved the postprocedural coronary flow and myocardial perfusion and the 6-month clinical outcomes.",

"A recent drug efficacy trial reported Coartem (artemether-lumefantrine) to be highly effective against Plasmodium falciparum in children less than 5 years of age in Papua New Guinea (PNG). In contrast, we have observed high levels of treatment failures in non-trial conditions in a longitudinal cohort study in the same age group in PNG. Recrudescences were confirmed by genotyping of three different marker genes to provide optimal discrimination power between parasite clones. After excluding genetic host factors by genotyping potentially relevant cytochrome P450 loci, the high number of treatment failures in our study is best explained by poor adherence to complex dosing regimens in combination with insufficient fat supplementation, which are both crucial parameters for the outcome of Coartem treatment. In contrast to the situation in classic drug trials with ideal treatment conditions, our field survey highlights potential problems with unsupervised usage of Coartem in routine clinical practice and under program conditions.",

"Chronic right ventricular apical (RVA) pacing can lead to an increased risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, but the acute effects of RVA pacing on left atrial (LA) function are not well known. Twenty-four patients with sick sinus syndrome and intact intrinsic atrioventricular conduction were included. All patients received dual-chamber pacemaker implants with the atrial lead in the right atrial appendage and the ventricular lead in the right ventricular (RV) apex. Transthoracic standard and strain echocardiography (measured by tissue Doppler imaging and speckle tracking image) were performed to identify functional changes in the left ventricle (LV) and LA before and after 1Â hour of RVA pacing. The LA volume index did not change after pacing; however, the ratio of peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity (E) to peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity (Ea) was significantly increased and peak systolic LA strain (Sm), mean peak systolic LA strain rate (SmSR), peak early diastolic LA strain rate (EmSR), and peak late diastolic LA strain rate (AmSR) were significantly reduced after RV pacing. LV dyssynchrony, induced by RV pacing, had a significant correlation with E/Ea, Sm, and SmSR after pacing. E/Ea also had a negative correlation with Sm and SmSR after pacing. Multivariate regression analysis identified LV dyssynchrony and E/Ea as important factors that affect Sm, SmSR, EmSR, and AmSR after acute RVA pacing. Acute RVA pacing results in LA functional change and LV dyssynchrony and higher LV filling pressures reflected by E/Ea are important causes of LA dysfunction after acute RVA pacing.",
"The results of Assessment Program effective treatment of patients with myocardiaL INfarction drug ProCORalan (ivabradine) in outpatient practice, conducted in 53 cities of the Russian Federation, 333 doctors. Included 1226 patients (822 men and 404 women, average age 60,1+/-9,3 years). Despite treatment, before inclusion in the patients maintained an average 8,17+/-8,60 (mediana 6) angina attacks per week, elevated blood pressure (141,8+/-20,3/86,2+/-11,6 mm Hg) and heart rate (84,5 +/-10,4 beats / min). Adding to ivabradine treatment for 16 weeks resulted in significant (p<0.00001) reduction in heart rate (up to 63,1+/-7,5 beats / min), the number of angina attacks per week (from 8.17 to 1.27) and need for nitroglycerin (from 7.69 to 0.89 tablets per week). Decreased the number of patients that called ambulance assistance (from 35.6 to 1.5%), and hospitalization (from 15.4 to 1.2%). There was a significant (p<0.00001) increase in evaluating the effectiveness of treatment (from 5,4+/-1,8 to 8,9 +/-1,3 points), reducing the risk stratification of patients (6,1+/-1,5 to 4 3+/-2,0 points), increased stability evaluation of state (from 5,6+/-1,9 to 3,7+/-2,2 points) and improved assessment of prognosis (from 5,7+/-2,0 to 3,6 +/-1,9 points). Expressed significantly positive effects observed after 1 month of therapy, after the effect became more pronounced. Significantly improved quality of life estimated by Seattle Angina Questionnaire and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure. The maximum recommended dose ivabradine of 15mg/day were given 50% of the patients, the dose of 10 mg/day - 28%. Adverse effects were reported in 3.3% of patients, of which, according to doctors associated with taking the drug - 0.82%. During follow up, 4 patients died. Thus, the addition of ivabradine to -blocker therapy, persons with a history of myocardial infarction and angina experiencing elevated heart rate, are the tactics of a rational and safe therapy.",

"Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) at birth was not associated with improved survival in a randomised, placebo-controlled trial in Guinea-Bissau. However, a negative sex-differential effect, which became evident after diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccination, was noted; among girls who had received DTP, VAS at birth was associated with two-fold higher mortality than placebo. The objective of the present study was to investigate the immunological effects of VAS at birth within a subgroup of participants in the randomised trial. Guided by the mortality results, we further explored whether VAS had a differential effect according to sex and DTP status. At 6 weeks after randomisation and supplementation, we measured differential leucocyte counts and TNF-Î±, interferon-Î³, IL-10, IL-13 and IL-5 production in a whole-blood culture assay. A total of 471 children were included. VAS compared with placebo at birth was associated with a higher proportion of monocytes (relative risk ratio 1Â·26, 95 % CI 1Â·07, 1Â·49, P=0Â·04), while spontaneous TNF-Î± production was lower in the VAS group (geometric mean ratio 0Â·54, 95 % CI, 0Â·37, 0Â·78, P=0Â·001). Stratified analysis showed that VAS was associated with lower TNF-Î± and IL-10 production for girls without DTP and boys with DTP, resulting in significant three-way interactions between VAS, sex and DTP vaccination status (P=0Â·03 and P=0Â·04, respectively) for spontaneous TNF-Î± and IL-10 production. The results substantiate the potential role of VAS as an immunomodulatory intervention, which has different effects depending on concomitant health interventions and the sex of the recipient.",
"The ability of interpleural analgesia to reduce the pain caused by an indwelling chest drain was evaluated in 22 patients treated for spontaneous pneumothorax. Intermittent 8-hourly bolus injections of 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine were compared with placebo in a randomized double-blind fashion. Visual analogue pain scale (VAS) scores were registered after the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th and 10th injections. The scores were significantly lower in the bupivacaine group at 5, 15, 30 and 60 min after the first injection. No significant differences in pain scores were found after 4 or 8 h. Pain scores in the bupivacaine group were also reduced after the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 10th injections, but compared with placebo the differences were significant only after the 2nd and 7th injections. Parenteral morphine consumption was not significantly lower in the bupivacaine group. Arterial blood gases were unaffected by the treatment in both groups. It is concluded that interpleural analgesia using bupivacaine given as bolus injections at 8-h intervals significantly reduces the pain caused by a chest drain within 5 min of injection, but the duration of pain relief is less than 4 h.",

"The aim of the present study was to explore the association between outbursts of anger and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) risk. Outbursts of anger are associated with an abrupt increase in cardiovascular events; however, it remains unknown whether greater levels of anger intensity are associated with greater levels of AMI risk or whether potentially modifiable factors can mitigate the short-term risk of AMI. We conducted a case-crossover analysis of 3,886 participants from the multicenter Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, who were interviewed during the index hospitalization for AMI from 1989 to 1996. We compared the observed number and intensity of anger outbursts in the 2 hours preceding AMI symptom onset with its expected frequency according to each patient's control information, defined as the number of anger outbursts in the previous year. Of the 3,886 participants in the Determinants of Myocardial Infarction Onset Study, 1,484 (38%) reported outbursts of anger in the previous year. The incidence rate of AMI onset was elevated 2.43-fold (95% confidence interval 2.01 to 2.90) within 2 hours of an outburst of anger. The association was consistently stronger with increasing anger intensities (p trend <0.001). In conclusion, the risk of experiencing AMI was more than twofold greater after outbursts of anger compared with at other times, and greater intensities of anger were associated with greater relative risks. Compared with nonusers, regular Î²-blocker users had a lower susceptibility to heart attacks triggered by anger, suggesting that some drugs might lower the risk from each anger episode.",
"Argemone mexicana (AM), a validated herbal medicine for uncomplicated malaria, seems to prevent severe malaria without completely clearing parasites in most patients. This study, in a high transmission area of South Mali, explores whether residual parasitaemia at day 28 was associated with subsequent malaria episodes and/or anaemia. Three hundred and one patients were randomly assigned to AM or artesunate/amodiaquine as first line treatment, of whom 294 were followed up beyond the standard 28 days, to 84 days. From day 29 to day 84, there were no significant differences between treatment groups in new clinical episodes of uncomplicated malaria (0.33 vs 0.31 episodes/patient), severe malaria (< 6% per month of patients aged â¤ 5 years) or moderate anaemia (hematocrit < 24%: 1.1% in both groups at day 84). Total parasite clearance at day 28 was not correlated with incidence of uncomplicated or severe malaria or of moderate anaemia over the subsequent two months. Total parasite clearance at day 28 was not clinically important in the context of high transmission. If this finding can be confirmed, some antimalarials which are clinically effective but do not completely clear parasites could nevertheless be appropriate in high transmission areas. Such a policy could be tested as a way to delay resistance to artemisinin combination therapies.",
"Analgesia and hydration remain the only safe treatment for painful crises of sickle cell disease; hydroxyurea is effective, but the toxicity is still a problem. Piracetam is a nootropic drug that has reportedly been effective and non-toxic in sickle cell patients, but most studies were not placebo-controlled and included a small number of patients. The present study evaluated the drug in a double-blind crossed placebo-controlled clinical trial in 73 children and adolescents suffering from moderate to severe painful crises for 13 months. Information regarding frequency and severity of pain was acquired through monthly clinical evaluation, visits and house calls, and 4,300 weekly questionnaires filled out by the patients in their domiciles. A monthly pain score was calculated for each patient. Pain was the most frequent adverse manifestation of the disease stressing its significant bio-psycho-social impact. Although nearly all patients and relatives reported a better clinical course throughout the whole study, the drug was ineffective in the prevention of painful crises. This placebo effect may be ascribed to an unplanned and unsystematic 'cognitive-behavioural' management of the children. The pain score in the second semester of the study - both in the experimental and in the control groups - was significantly smaller than that in the first semester. In conclusion, piracetam was found to be ineffective in the prevention of painful crises; a powerful placebo effect due to adequate patient care was demonstrated.",
"The assumption that statin therapy can decrease asymmetric dimethylarginine through lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels seems logical and yet arises some controversy. The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of moderate (40 mg) to high (80 mg) simvastatin doses on asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine levels in patients with newly detected severe hypercholesterolemia (after target LDL-C levels, â¤2.6 mmol/L, are reached). The study included 120 adult patients with newly detected severe hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol â¥7.5 mmol/L and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol â¥4.9 mmol/L). Asymmetric dimethylarginine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, total homocysteine-by a high-performance liquid chromatographic method. There was a statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein-B levels as well as in the apolipoprotein-B/apolipoprotein-A1 index after a 1-month therapy with 40 mg simvastatin (P <0.001). Asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine levels were also decreased but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.571; P= 0.569). A dose-dependent effect was established, comparing the influence of moderate (40 mg) to high (80 mg) simvastatin doses on the tested atherogenic biomarkers (lipid profile, apolipoprotein-A1, and apolipoprotein-B). Asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine levels were lowered significantly with 80 mg simvastatin (P <0.001; P= 0.038). In conclusion, optimizing the target values of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a moderate dose (40 mg) of simvastatin has no effect on asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine in contrast to a high dose (80 mg) after target LDL-C levels are reached (â¤2.6 mmol/L) in patients with newly detected severe hypercholesterolemia.",
"Simple thoracoscopic talcage (TT) is a safe and effective treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). However, its efficacy has not previously been estimated in comparison with standard conservative therapy (pleural drainage (PD)). In this prospective randomised comparison of two well-established procedures of treating PSP requiring at least a chest tube, cost-effectiveness, safety and pain control was evaluated in 108 patients with PSP (61 TT and 47 PD). Patients in both groups had comparable clinical characteristics. Drainage and hospitalisation duration were similar in TT and PD patients. There were no complications in either group. The immediate success rate was different: after prolonged drainage (>7 days), 10 out of 47 PD patients, but only 1 out of 61 TT patients required a TT as a second procedure. Total costs of hospitalisation including any treatment procedure were not significantly different between TT and PD patients. Pain, measured daily by visual analogue scales, was statistically higher during the first 3 days in TT patients but not in those patients receiving opiates. One month after leaving hospital, there was no significant difference in residual pain or full working ability: 20 out of 58 (34%) versus 10 out of 47 (21%) and 36 out of 61 (59%) versus 26 out of 39 (67%) in TT versus PD groups, respectively. After 5 yrs of follow-up, there had been only three out of 59 (5%) recurrences of pneumothorax after TT, but 16 out of 47 (34%) after conservative treatment by PD. Cost calculation favoured TT pleurodesis especially with regard to recurrences. In conclusion, thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis under local anaesthesia is superior to conservative treatment by chest tube drainage in cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax that fail simple aspiration, provided there is efficient control of pain by opioids.",
"In order to test the clinical usefulness of new commercially available kits for determination of calcitonin serum concentrations, we investigated the family (N = 10) of a patient with medullary thyroid carcinoma and bilateral pheochromocytoma including his affected son, 10 athyreotic patients, totally thyroidectomized for non-medullary thyroid cancer, and 4 normal volunteers. Pentagastrin tests were performed in all subjects. Serum calcitonin levels before and after pentagastrin were determined by 4 kits. Kits A and B are immunoradiometric assays of the sandwich-type, kits C and D are radioimmunoassays, D being the one hitherto routinely used. Our results show that the new assays (kits A, B and C) have a better diagnostic accuracy in screening for medullary thyroid cancer than the RIA (kit D), hitherto used, where basal values overlapped with normals. Although basal values of normals were mostly near the detection limit of all 4 kits, kits A and B were sensitive enough to detect stimulation of calcitonin secretion by pentagastrin in all subjects with intact thyroid glands and kit C in most of them. The lack of increase in calcitonin after pentagastrin observed by kits A, B and C in athyreotic patients suggests deficiency of secretion of this hormone. Only kit D was unable to show this deficiency.",
"Although gemifloxacin has low in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the effect of gemifloxacin on the delay of tuberculosis (TB) treatment has not been validated in a clinical setting. The study group included patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB who initially received gemifloxacin for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Two control groups contained patients treated with other fluoroquinolones or nonfluoroquinolone antibiotics. Sixteen cases were treated with gemifloxacin for suspected CAP before TB diagnosis. Sixteen and 32 patients were treated with other fluoroquinolones and nonfluoroquinolones, respectively. The median period from the initiation of antibiotics to the administration of anti-TB medication was nine days in the gemifloxacin group, which was significantly different from the other fluoroquinolones group (35 days). The median times for the nonfluoroquinolone group and the gemifloxacin group were not significantly different. There were no significant differences between the gemifloxacin and other fluoroquinolone group in terms of symptomatic and radiographic improvements. However, the frequency of radiographic improvement in the other fluoroquinolones group tended to be higher than in the gemifloxacin group. Gemifloxacin might be the preferred fluoroquinolone for treating CAP, to alleviate any concerns about delaying TB treatment.",

"Rapid tuberculosis (TB) detection is critical for disease control, and further quantitation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in sputum is valuable for epidemiological and clinical studies. We evaluated a simple, robust and cost-efficient in-house DNA extraction and downstream Taqman approach for detection and quantitation of Mtb genomes from sputum of newly-diagnosed TB patients and non-TB controls. DNA was extracted using guanidine isothiocyanate and silica-based spin columns in less than 2 h, stored frozen, and Taqman assays were used to detect Mtb with IS6110 and quantify it targeting RD1 and IS1081. The Taqmans had a sensitivity >95% in 108 culture-confirmed TB patients and specificity of 100% in 43 non-TB controls. Genome counts were correlated with the Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tubes' (MGIT) time-to-detection values (1/TTD Ã 1000; rho = 0.66; p < 0.001) in 91 TB patients (33 excluded with MGIT contamination). This linear relationship was nearly identical between mycobacteria isolated from sputum and H37Rv Mtb grown in-vitro to its log phase. TB treatment between 3 and 7 days was associated with lower 1/TTD Ã 1000 values but not with genome counts. Together, our protocol provides rapid, specific, inexpensive and quantitative detection of Mtb DNA in fresh or stored sputa making it a robust tool for prompt TB diagnosis, and with potential use for clinical and epidemiologic studies.",

Our aims were to determine whether 1) sex affects the myocardial metabolic response to lipid lowering in T2DM, 2) altering lipid [fatty acid (FA) or triglyceride] delivery to the heart would lower the elevated myocardial lipid metabolism associated with T2DM, and 3) decreasing lipid delivery improves diastolic dysfunction in T2DM. To this end, we studied 78 T2DM patients (43 women) with positron emission tomography, echocardiography, and whole body tracer studies before and 3 mo after randomization to metformin (MET), metformin + rosiglitazone (ROSI), or metformin + Lovaza (LOV). No treatment main effects were found for myocardial substrate metabolism, partly because men and women often had different responses to a given treatment. In men, MET decreased FA clearance, which was linked to increased plasma FA levels, myocardial FA utilization and oxidation, and lower myocardial glucose utilization. In women, ROSI increased FA clearance, thereby decreasing plasma FA levels and myocardial FA utilization. Although LOV did not change triglyceride levels, it improved diastolic function, particularly in men. Group and sex also interacted in determining myocardial glucose uptake. Thus, in T2DM, different therapeutic regimens impact myocardial metabolism and diastolic function in a sex-specific manner. This suggests that sex should be taken into account when designing a patient's diabetes treatment.",
"For drug-compliant patients, poor responses to tuberculosis (TB) treatment might be attributable to subtherapeutic drug concentrations. An impaired absorption of rifampin was previously reported for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) or HIV. The objectives of this study were to determine whether TB drug pharmacokinetics differed in Peruvian TB patients with DM or HIV. In this cross-sectional study, TB patients, recruited from health centers in Lima, Peru, had blood samples taken at 2 and 6 h after directly observed TB drug ingestion, to determine plasma concentrations of rifampin. Of 105 patients, 50 had TB without a comorbidity, 26 had coexistent DM, and 29 had coexistent HIV. Unexpectedly, the overall median 2- and 6-h levels of rifampin were 1.6 and 3.2 mg/liter, respectively, and the time to the peak concentration was 6 h (slow absorber) instead of 2 h (fast absorber) for 61 patients (62.2%). The geometric mean peak concentration of drug in serum (C(max)) was significantly higher in fast absorbers than in slow absorbers (5.0 versus 3.8 mg/liter; P = 0.05). The rifampin C(max) was significantly lower in male patients than in female patients (3.3 versus 6.3 mg/liter; P < 0.001). Neither slow nor fast absorbers with comorbidities (DM or HIV) had significantly different C(max) results compared to those of TB patients without comorbidities. An analysis of variance regression analysis showed that female gender (P < 0.001) and the time to maximum concentration of drug in serum (T(max)) at 2 h (P = 0.012) were independently correlated with increased exposure to rifampin. Most of this Peruvian study population exhibited rifampin pharmacokinetics different from those conventionally reported, with delayed absorption and low plasma concentrations, independent of the presence of an HIV or DM comorbidity.",

"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common significant cardiac rhythm disorder, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Atrial fibrillation confers a fivefold increased risk of stroke, and these strokes are associated with significant mortality and disability. The vitamin K antagonist, warfarin, has been the mainstay of anticoagulant therapy for patients with AF, reducing the risk of stroke by 65%. Despite its efficacy, warfarin remains underused in clinical practice because of its variable dose response, diet and medication interactions, and need for frequent monitoring. Stroke prevention in AF has entered an exciting therapeutic era with new classes of targeted anticoagulants that avoid the many pitfalls of the vitamin K antagonists. Dabigatran, an oral thrombin inhibitor, and the factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, have demonstrated efficacy for stroke prevention and a reduced risk of intracranial hemorrhage relative to warfarin. Translating the efficacy of clinical trials into effective use of these novel agents in clinical practice will require an understanding of their pharmacokinetic profiles, dose selection, and management in select clinical situations.",
"There are few data on the incidence and clinical outcomes of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) treated in the era of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We analyzed 30-day clinical outcomes in 3,307 consecutive patients with and without AF (sinus rhythm) undergoing PCI from January 2007 through December 2008 enrolled in a multicenter Australian registry. Periprocedural AF was present in 162 patients (4.9%). AF was associated with older age (74.1 Â± 8.9 vs 63.9 Â± 11.9 years, p <0.001), higher baseline serum creatinine (0.13 Â± 0.14 vs 0.10 Â± 0.13 mmol/L, p = 0.01), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (49.5 Â± 13.2% vs 53.4% Â± 11.6%, p <0.001). Significantly more patients with AF had a history of heart failure and cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial diseases (p â¤0.01 for all comparisons). Periprocedural glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (31.5% vs 31.4%, p = 0.98) and antithrombin use were not different between groups, but in-hospital bleeding complications were higher in patients with AF (5.0% vs 2.1%, p = 0.015). Fewer patients with AF received drug-eluting stents (p = 0.004). AF was associated with a greater than fourfold increase in 30-day mortality (9.9% vs 2.2%, p <0.0001) and readmission rates at 30 days (p = 0.01). Fewer patients with AF were on dual antiplatelet therapy at 30 days (86.3% vs 94.3%, p <0.0001), although 28.1% of patients with AF were on triple therapy (dual antiplatelet therapy plus oral anticoagulation). In conclusion, patients with periprocedural AF represent a very high-risk group. Excess 30-day morbidity and mortality after PCI may be due to the higher incidence of co-morbidities, bleeding complications, and suboptimal antiplatelet therapy.",

"Left ventricular (LV) function is generally assessed independent of structural remodeling and vice versa. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel LV global function index (LVGFI) that integrates LV structure with global function and to assess its predictive value for cardiovascular (CV) events throughout adult life in a multiethnic population of men and women without history of CV diseases at baseline. A total of 5004 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis underwent a cardiac magnetic resonance study and were followed up for a median of 7.2 years. The LVGFI by cardiac magnetic resonance was defined by the ratio of stroke volume divided by LV total volume defined as the sum of mean LV cavity and myocardial volumes. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to predict the end points of heart failure, hard CV events, and a combined end point of all CV events after adjustment for established risk factors, calcium score, and biomarkers. A total of 579 (11.6%) CV events were observed during the follow-up period. In adjusted models, the end points of heart failure, hard CV events, and all events were all significantly associated with LVGFI (heart failure, hazard ratio=0.64, P<0.0001; hard CV events, hazard ratio=0.79, P=0.007; all events, hazard ratio=0.79, P<0.0001). LVGFI had a significant independent predictive value in the multivariable models for all CV event categories. The LVGFI was a powerful predictor of incident HF, hard CV events, and a composite end point, including all events in this multiethnic cohort.",

"The words 'defaulter', 'suspect' and 'control' have been part of the language of tuberculosis (TB) services for many decades, and they continue to be used in international guidelines and in published literature. From a patient perspective, it is our opinion that these terms are at best inappropriate, coercive and disempowering, and at worst they could be perceived as judgmental and criminalising, tending to place the blame of the disease or responsibility for adverse treatment outcomes on one side-that of the patients. In this article, which brings together a wide range of authors and institutions from Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe and the Pacific, we discuss the use of the words 'defaulter', 'suspect' and 'control' and argue why it is detrimental to continue using them in the context of TB. We propose that 'defaulter' be replaced with 'person lost to follow-up'; that 'TB suspect' be replaced by 'person with presumptive TB' or 'person to be evaluated for TB'; and that the term 'control' be replaced with 'prevention and care' or simply deleted. These terms are non-judgmental and patient-centred. We appeal to the global Stop TB Partnership to lead discussions on this issue and to make concrete steps towards changing the current paradigm.",
"The relationship between malnutrition and malaria in young children is under debate, and no studies evaluating the association between malnutrition and response to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) have been published. We evaluated the association between malnutrition and response to antimalarial therapy in Ugandan children treated with ACTs for repeated episodes of malaria. Children aged 4 to 12 months diagnosed with uncomplicated malaria were randomized to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) or artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and followed for up to 2 years. All HIV-exposed and HIV-infected children received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis (TS). The primary exposure variables included height-for-age and weight-for-age z scores. Outcomes included parasite clearance at days 2 and 3 and risk of recurrent parasitemia after 42 days of follow-up. Two hundred ninety-two children were randomized to DP or AL, resulting in 2,013 malaria treatments. Fewer than 1% of patients had a positive blood smear by day 3 (DP, 0.2%; AL, 0.6% [P = 0.18]). There was no significant association between height-for-age or weight-for-age z scores and a positive blood smear 2 days following treatment. For children treated with DP but not on TS, decreasing height-for-age z scores of <-1 were associated with a higher risk of recurrent parasitemia than a height-for-age z score of >0 (hazard ratio [HR] for height-for-age z score of <-1 and â¥-2 = 2.89 [P = 0.039]; HR for height-for-age z score of <-2 = 3.18 [P = 0.022]). DP and AL are effective antimalarial therapies in chronically malnourished children in a high-transmission setting. However, children with mild to moderate chronic malnutrition not taking TS are at higher risk for recurrent parasitemia and may be considered a target for chemoprevention.",

"The established marker for tubular damage, urinary n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase is significantly increased in type 1 and 2 diabetes patients and is related to albuminuria and other diabetic complications. In this cross sectional study of type 2 diabetes patients with a history of albuminuria, we studied the relationship between excretion of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase in urine and diabetic neuropathy.160 type 2 diabetes patients were screened for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase excretion was detected in 24 h urine samples.Urinary excretion of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase correlated significantly with -glucose control (fasting glucose r=0.18; p=0.04; HbA1c r=0.20; p=0.02) and urine albumin excretion (r=0.22; p=0.01). Binary regression analyses showed that increased urinary n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase concentration is an independent predictor for presence of clinical symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (OR 1.8 [95%CI 1.2-2.74] and vibration deficiency [OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.66]. There was also a significant negative association between urinary n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and E/I-Ratio (r=-0.21, p<0.02) as well as the 30:15-Ratio (r=-0.24; p<0.01) of heart rate variability. Furthermore, increased n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase excretion independently predicted cardiovascular autonomic diabetic neuropathy with an OR for decreased E/I-Ratio of 1.7 [95%CI 1.1-2.75]; (p<0.02) and 30:15-Ratio:OR 2.4 [95% CI 1.26-4.45]; (p<0.01).Urinary n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosami-nidase excretion is an independent marker for diabetic peripheral and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy in type 2 diabetic patients.",

"A prospective randomized study was carried out at the Detroit General Hospital over a two year period to evaluate methods of management in 165 patients with colonic injuries. Results of the study show that primary closure is a safe and reiable method of management when rigid criteria are incorporated in an ongoing protocol. Moreover, the technic of exteriorization is a safe adjunct to management and is recommended in any patient with a colonic injury above 18 cm in which one suture line is required and in which the additional operating time of twenty minutes will not compromise the management of secondary injuries. Patients not fulfilling these criteria should have primary colostomy. These principles make it possible to reduce the need for primary colostomy to approximately 50 per cent in a large ongoing group of patients with colonic injury.",
"A new generation of strategies is evolving that aim to block malaria transmission by employing genetically modified vectors or mosquito pathogens or symbionts that express anti-parasite molecules. Whilst transgenic technologies have advanced rapidly, there is still a paucity of effector molecules with potent anti-malaria activity whose expression does not cause detrimental effects on mosquito fitness. Our objective was to examine a wide range of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) for their toxic effects on Plasmodium and anopheline mosquitoes. Specifically targeting early sporogonic stages, we initially screened AMPs for toxicity against a mosquito cell line and P. berghei ookinetes. Promising candidate AMPs were fed to mosquitoes to monitor adverse fitness effects, and their efficacy in blocking rodent malaria infection in Anopheles stephensi was assessed. This was followed by tests to determine their activity against P. falciparum in An. gambiae, initially using laboratory cultures to infect mosquitoes, then culminating in preliminary assays in the field using gametocytes and mosquitoes collected from the same area in Mali, West Africa. From a range of 33 molecules, six AMPs able to block Plasmodium development were identified: Anoplin, Duramycin, Mastoparan X, Melittin, TP10 and Vida3. With the exception of Anoplin and Mastoparan X, these AMPs were also toxic to an An. gambiae cell line at a concentration of 25 ÂµM. However, when tested in mosquito blood feeds, they did not reduce mosquito longevity or egg production at concentrations of 50 ÂµM. Peptides effective against cultured ookinetes were less effective when tested in vivo and differences in efficacy against P. berghei and P. falciparum were seen. From the range of molecules tested, the majority of effective AMPs were derived from bee/wasp venoms.",

After a follow-up of 12 months in all patients, 26 patients (52%) in group 1 versus 43 (82.7%) in group 2 were free from any AF/AT (pÂ = 0.001) after a single procedure. No major complications occurred.",
"Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) are now being adopted as first-line treatments against uncomplicated malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Between December 2009 and February 2010, the efficacies of two ACT - dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-P) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) - in the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria were compared in Sinnar, central Sudan. Overall, 149 patients (75 given DHA-P and 74 given AL) completed the 28 days of follow-up. All the patients were found to be afebrile and aparasitaemic on day 3. By day 28, only one patient, who had been given AL, showed late treatment and parasitological failures, while each of the other 148 patients showed an adequate treatment response. After the results of a PCR-based assay confirmed that the recrudescent parasitaemia was probably the result of treatment failure, the frequencies of cure by day 28 were calculated as 100% for DHA-P and 98.7% for AL (P>0.05). None of the patients was found gametocytaemic during the follow-up, and the adverse effects observed were mild (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness and/or rash), resolved spontaneously and occurred in only five patients in each treatment arm. Thus, both treatments appeared effective and safe for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in central Sudan, although treatment with DHA-P (which requires a simpler dosing regimen) might be preferred to treatment with AL.",

"A double-blind phase III malaria prevention trial was conducted in two refugee camps using pre-manufactured insecticide-treated plastic sheeting (ITPS) or untreated polyethylene sheeting (UPS) randomly deployed to defined sectors of each camp. In Largo camp the ITPS or UPS was attached to inner walls and ceilings of shelters, whereas in Tobanda the ITPS or UPS was used to line only the ceiling and roof. In Largo the Plasmodium falciparum incidence rate in children up to 3 years of age who were cleared of parasites and monitored for 8 months was 163/100 person-years under UPS and 63 under ITPS (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.33-0.47). In Tobanda incidence was 157/100 person-years under UPS and 134 under ITPS (AOR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.75-0.95). Protective efficacy was 61% under fully lined ITPS and 15% under roof lined ITPS. Anemia rates improved under ITPS in both camps. This novel tool proved to be a convenient, safe, and long-lasting method of malaria control when used as a full shelter lining in an emergency setting.",

The overall failure rate was 10.1%; adults 10.7%; children 6.2%. The frequency of complications were: hypotension: 4.6%; vascular puncture: 3.8%; pleural puncture: 1.1%; pneumothorax: 0.5%. Since these results are similar to those found with alternative methods, e.g. epidural, intrapleural and intercostal blocks, paravertebral block can be recommended as an effective, safe technique for unilateral analgesia in both adults and children.",
"We report results of a pilot study of high-dose vitamin D in sickle cell disease (SCD). Subjects were given a 6-week course of oral high-dose cholecalciferol (4000-100Â 000 IU per week) or placebo and monitored prospectively for a period of six months. Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency was present at baseline in 82Â·5% and 52Â·5% of subjects, respectively. Subjects who received high-dose vitamin D achieved higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, experienced fewer pain days per week, and had higher physical activity quality-of-life scores. These findings suggest a potential benefit of vitamin D in reducing the number of pain days in SCD. Larger prospective studies with longer duration are needed to confirm these effects.",
"We undertook a randomized, controlled trial to determine whether human surfactant administered endotracheally at birth to very premature infants (gestational age, 24 to 29 weeks) would prevent the respiratory distress syndrome or reduce its severity. Thirty-one treated infants (birth weight, 938 +/- 286 g) were compared in a blinded fashion with 29 control infants (birth weight, 964 +/- 174 g). The lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio was less than 2 in all infants, and phosphatidylglycerol was not present in amniotic fluid or tracheal fluids at birth, indicating a deficiency of surfactant in the lungs. The principal dependent variables were neonatal death, the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and the infant's requirement for respiratory support (and its complications). The surfactant-treated group had significantly fewer deaths than the control group (16 percent vs. 52 percent, P less than 0.001), fewer cases of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (16 percent vs. 31 percent), and significantly fewer cases of pulmonary interstitial emphysema (P less than 0.001) and pneumothorax (P less than 0.02). Prophylactic treatment with human surfactant also substantially reduced the period of neonatal intensive care. We conclude that treatment with human surfactant offers promise for improving the survival of very premature infants with a surfactant deficiency and for reducing the pulmonary sequelae of the respiratory distress syndrome.",
"Rivaroxaban is a factor Xa inhibitor that was recently reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration as a potential therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Approval of this drug would represent a paradigm shift away from dual antiplatelet therapy toward long-term triple antithrombotic therapy. However, to date, no other experimental anticoagulant agent has demonstrated a favorable risk-benefit profile in this population, in part because of the expected increased risk in major bleeding by combining aspirin, a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, and an anticoagulant. Approvability of rivaroxaban was considered largely on the basis of the ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 (Anti-Xa Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events in Addition to Standard Therapy in Subjects With Acute Coronary Syndrome ACS 2-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 51) trial, which demonstrated a significant reduction in a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Although the primary efficacy endpoint was met, a substantial amount of missing data was observed. We discuss the impact of missing data in this trial, its implications for informative censoring of safety events (major bleeding), and implications for future cardiovascular outcomes trials.",

"The goal of this study was to characterize determinants of infarct size in the multicenter randomized Counterpulsation to Reduce Infarct Size Pre-PCI Acute Myocardial Infarction (CRISP-AMI) trial. Contemporary determinants of infarct size in patients presenting with acute anterior myocardial infarction without shock and undergoing percutaneous revascularization have been incompletely characterized. In CRISP-AMI, 337 patients with acute anterior ST segment elevation myocardial infarction but without cardiogenic shock at 30 sites in 9 countries were randomized to initiation of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation before primary percutaneous coronary intervention versus standard of care. The primary outcome was infarct size as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 3 to 5 days after percutaneous coronary intervention. Of 337 randomized patients, complete periprocedural and infarct size data were available in 250 patients (74%). After a comparison of baseline characteristics to ensure no significant differences, patients with missing data were excluded. Using multiple linear regression of 23 variables, time from symptom onset to first device (Î² = 0.022, p = 0.047) and preprocedural Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 0/1 (Î² = 15.28, p <0.001) were independent predictors of infarct size. Infarct size increased by 0.43% per 30 minutes in early reperfusion and by 0.63% every 30 minutes in late reperfusion. In conclusion, in patients with acute anterior ST elevation myocardial infraction without cardiogenic shock, total ischemic time and preprocedural Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 0/1 were associated with increased infarct size as determined by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. These findings underscore the importance of systems of care aimed at reducing total ischemic time to open infarct arteries.",

"Chronic hyperglycemia impairs insulin action, resulting in glucotoxicity, which can be ameliorated in animal models by inducing glucosuria with renal glucose transport inhibitors. Here, we examined whether reduction of plasma glucose with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor could improve insulin-mediated tissue glucose disposal in patients with type 2 diabetes. Eighteen diabetic men were randomized to receive either dapagliflozin (n = 12) or placebo (n = 6) for 2 weeks. We measured insulin-mediated whole body glucose uptake and endogenous glucose production (EGP) at baseline and 2 weeks after treatment using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. Dapagliflozin treatment induced glucosuria and markedly lowered fasting plasma glucose. Insulin-mediated tissue glucose disposal increased by approximately 18% after 2 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment, while placebo-treated subjects had no change in insulin sensitivity. Surprisingly, following dapagliflozin treatment, EGP increased substantially and was accompanied by an increase in fasting plasma glucagon concentration. Together, our data indicate that reduction of plasma glucose with an agent that works specifically on the kidney to induce glucosuria improves muscle insulin sensitivity. However, glucosuria induction following SGLT2 inhibition is associated with a paradoxical increase in EGP. These results provide support for the glucotoxicity hypothesis, which suggests that chronic hyperglycemia impairs insulin action in individuals with type 2 diabetes.",
"In this large, US population sample, both migraine and PM were more common among females, but a sex difference was not observed in the prevalence of other severe headache. The sex difference in migraine and PM held true across age and for most other sociodemographic variables with the exception of race for PM. Females with migraine and PM had higher rates of most migraine symptoms, aura, greater associated impairment, and higher healthcare resource utilization than males. Corresponding sex differences were not observed among individuals with other severe headache on the majority of these comparisons. Results suggest that PM is part of the migraine spectrum whereas other severe headache types are not. Results also substantiate existing literature on sex differences in primary headaches and extend results to additional headache types and related factors.",
"Given the conflicting results about the positive effects of magnesium and L-carnitine and as there is no report concerning concurrent supplementation of magnesium and L-carnitine on migraine prophylaxis, the effects of magnesium, L-carnitine, and concurrent magnesium-L-carnitine supplementation on migraine indicators were assessed. In this clinical trial, 133 migrainous patients were randomly assigned into three intervention groups: magnesium oxide (500Â mg/day), L-carnitine (500Â mg/day), and Mg-L-carnitine (500Â mg/day magnesium and 500Â mg/dayâL-carnitine), and a control group. After 12Â weeks of supplementation, the checklist of migraine indicators including migraine attacks/month, migraine days/month, and headache severity was completed, and serum concentrations of magnesium and L-carnitine were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and enzymatic UV test, respectively. The results showed a significant reduction in all migraine indicators in all studied groups (pâ<â0.05). The ANOVA results showed a significant reduction in migraine frequency across various supplemented and control groups (pâ=â0.008). By separating the effects of magnesium supplementation from other confounding factors such as routine treatments using the repeated measures and nested model, it was clarified that magnesium supplementation had a significant effect on all migraine indicators. Oral supplementation with magnesium oxide and L-carnitine and concurrent supplementation of Mg-L-carnitine besides routine treatments could be effective in migraine prophylaxis; however, larger trials are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",

Infection was safe and parasitemia developed in 15 of 18 volunteers (84%), 5 of 6 volunteers in each group. There were no differences between groups in time until parasitemia by microscopy or quantitative polymerase chain reaction, parasite kinetics, clinical symptoms, or laboratory values. This is the first successful infection by needle and syringe with PfSPZ manufactured in compliance with regulatory standards.

"Circulating total free fatty acid (FFA) levels are elevated early in myocardial infarction (MI) and have been associated with an increase in mortality. We investigated the association of serum unbound FFA (FFAu) levels with mortality in patients presenting with ST-segment elevation MI in the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction II trial. The Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction II trial enrolled patients within 4 hours of chest pain onset. The patients were treated with a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator within 1 hour of enrollment. The FFAu concentration was evaluated in serum samples from 1,834 patients obtained at baseline, before therapy. The FFAu level was an independent risk factor for death as early as at 1 day of hospitalization and continued to be an independent risk factor for the >3.8 years of follow-up. When adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors, the FFAu levels in the fourth versus the first quartile remained an independent risk factor for death from MI (hazard ratio 5.0, 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 13.0), all cardiac death (hazard ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.4), and all-cause death (hazard ratio 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 3.1). Women were twice as likely to be in the upper 2 FFAu quartiles and had approximately twice the rate of death as men. In conclusion, FFAu elevation is 1 of the earliest molecular biomarkers of mortality in patients with ST-segment elevation MI and was independent of other risk factors known to affect the outcomes after ST-segment elevation MI.",
"This study was undertaken to assess tolerability, quality of life, and persistency of use and to monitor changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) during the first 6 mo after a switch to fixed combination latanoprost/timolol. In Germany, 271 general ophthalmology practices enrolled patients who were switched from previous ocular hypotensive therapies to latanoprost/timolol for medical reasons. Usual care routines were followed, and IOP was measured at baseline and approximately 6 mo later. Adverse events were recorded throughout. Immediately before switching and at follow-up, patients completed a 29-item quality-of-life questionnaire. Of 1052 patients who met analysis criteria, 748 (71%) switched from combination therapy and 304 (29%) from monotherapy. An insufficient IOP reduction with the previous therapy was a reason for switching in 71% of patients; the desire to simplify to once-daily administration was cited in 66%. Ocular adverse events were reported in 19 patients after the switch, and 97% remained on therapy throughout the follow%up period. After switching, patients were less likely to forget to instill their eyedrops or to feel that their drops had adverse effects; they found it easier to include eyedrop administration in their routine; they were more satisfied with the frequency of instillation; and they were more likely to want to continue with the drops. Across all previous therapies, mean IOP decreased from 20.6+/-3.7 mm Hg to 17.2+/-2.8 mm Hg after the switch (P<.001)-a 14.8% difference. Fixed combination latanoprost/timolol is well tolerated and effective in patients who are switched from other monotherapies or combination therapies for medical reasons. Such a switch may be associated with improved quality of life.",

"In the first part of this study, 61 patients admitted for the first episode or the first recurrence of a spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) were randomly treated with thoracic drainage (TD; 28 patients) or with simple needle aspiration (NA; 33 patients). Success rate of therapy was significantly higher with TD than with NA (93%, CI 84 to 100 vs 67%, CI 51 to 83; p = 0.01). Hospital stay was similar between the two groups (7 +/- 4.6 vs 7 +/- 5.6 days), mainly because NA was delayed by 72 h in 26 patients. Recurrence rates at 3 months were 29% (CI 11 to 47%) after TD, and 14% (CI 0 to 29%) after NA (p > 0.20, NS). In the second part of the study, an additional population of 35 patients was treated by immediate NA, with a success rate of 68.5% (CI 53.5 to 83.5%), and a recurrence rate at 3 months of 30% (CI 10 to 50%). Taken together, our results indicate that NA may be proposed as a first-line treatment of SP, with a successful result in two thirds of patients and recurrence in one fifth of patients. In patients who do not heal with NA, a combined risk of TD failure and short-term recurrence of 50% may be an incentive for undelayed surgical procedures.",

In this multicenter, open-label, prospective evaluation, the intraocular pressure (IOP) of the 43 enrolled patients was > or =18 mm Hg after at least 6 wk of latanoprost monotherapy. The primary outcome measure was IOP at peak drug effect )10 AM, or approximately 2 h after the morning dose of brimonidine 0.15%(. IOP at trough drug effect (8 AM, or approximately 12 h after the evening dose of brimonidine) was also measured. Baseline IOP was 21.9 (+/-2.3) mm Hg. After 1 mo of treatment, additional mean IOP reductions from latanoprost-treated baseline values were 5.8 mm Hg (26%) at peak drug effect (P<.001) and 3.3 mm Hg (15%) at trough (P<.001). At the month 2 visit, additional mean IOP reductions from latanoprost-treated baseline values were 5.1 mm Hg (23%) at peak drug effect (P<.001) and 2.0 mm Hg (9%) at trough (P=.002). Brimonidine Purite 0.15% provided statistically significant additional reductions in IOP from latanoprost-treated baseline values. These findings suggest that brimonidine Purite 0.15% is an efficacious adjunctive therapy in patients given latanoprost who require additional lowering of IOP.",

"Twenty-seven consecutive patients with endocrinological disease necessitating adrenal surgery underwent blind preoperative investigation with ultrasound, renal aortography, and adrenocortical scintigraphy for an adrenal lesion. Nine patients had pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome, five had pituitary-independent Cushing's syndrome, four had an adrenocortical androgenic excess, and nine had a preoperative diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma. The predictive value of preoperative ultrasound was 100% for a positive finding and 79% for a negative result. Preoperative aortography had a predictive value of 83% for a positive finding and 64% for a negative result; and the predictive value of adrenocortical scintigraphy was 100% for a positive finding and 85% for a negative finding. In localising biochemically suspected adrenal lesions ultrasound should be the first choice, since it is rapid, noninvasive, cheap, and reasonably accurate. Adrenocortical scintigraphy has a similar diagnostic value, especially in Cushing's syndrome, but it is time consuming. Nevertheless, it may be preferable for diagnosing small glucocorticoid-secreting adenomas. Aortography should be reserved for cases with inconclusive diagnoses and suspected extra-adrenal phaeochromocytomas.",

"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is one of the incretins, gut hormones released from the intestine in response to food intake. GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have been used to treat type 2 diabetes. Here, we studied the effect of the administration of a GLP-1R agonist, liraglutide, on proteinuria and the progression of overt DN in type 2 diabetic patients. Twenty-three type 2 diabetic patients with overt DN, who had already been treated with blockade of renin-angiotensin system under dietary sodium restriction, were given liraglutide for a period of 12 months. Treatment with liraglutide caused a significant decrease in HbA1c from 7.4 Â± 0.2% to 6.9 Â± 0.3% (p = 0.04), and in body mass index (BMI) from 27.6 Â± 0.9 kg/mÂ² to 26.5 Â± 0.8 kg/mÂ² after 12 months (p < 0.001), while systolic blood pressure did not change. The progression of DN was determined as the rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The 12-month administration of liraglutide caused a significant decrease in proteinuria from 2.53 Â± 0.48 g/g creatinine to 1.47 Â± 0.28 g/g creatinine (p = 0.002). The administration of liraglutide also substantially diminished the rate of decline in eGFR from 6.6 Â± 1.5 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²/year to 0.3 Â± 1.9 mL/min/1.73 mÂ²/year (p = 0.003). Liraglutide can be used not only for reducing HbA1c and BMI, but also for attenuating the progression of nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients.",

"The benefit of preoperative percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage in patients with obstructive jaundice was reviewed in the literature from 1974 to July 1984. The role of preoperative drainage cannot be definitively assessed. Significant reduction of morbidity and mortality has been reported in some non-controlled studies; however, no benefit of preoperative "external" drainage was found in the only two reported randomized studies. At the present time external preoperative drainage cannot be advised routinely and the hazards of this technique and effect of bile losses may outweigh the benefits. The benefits of preoperative internal drainage without bile loss and closing of the enterohepatic cycle needs to be evaluated both percutaneously and endoscopically. Criteria, developed after specific identification of high risk patients, should be used to select patients for biliary drainage and to evaluate results of drainage studies. The clinical well-accepted drainage period of 2-4 weeks is controversial and the optimum period of drainage also requires further evaluation. The percutaneous approach carries significant morbidity and mortality.",
"One-month Phase II trial was conducted in 43 sputum smear-positive patients with pulmonary tuberculosis randomized into treatment (n = 22) and placebo (n = 21) arms to investigate the safety and efficacy of an orally-administered therapeutic TB vaccine (V7) containing 10 Î¼g of heat-killed Mycobacterium vaccae provided by Longcom company. Immunotherapy and control groups comprised 8 newly diagnosed (1stDx TB; 18.6%), 6 re-treated (RTB; 14%), and 29 multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB; 67.4%) cases distributed at 5:4:13 and 3:2:16 ratios, respectively. Both arms received conventional TB drugs administered under directly observed therapy. The average weight gain in V7 arm was modest, but statistically significant (0.6 kg; p = 0.004), while placebo patients lost 0.1 kg (p = 0.77). Except defervescence and increased lymphocyte percentage, other secondary endpoints such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leukocyte counts and hemoglobin content were not significantly affected. In control patients only one secondary endpoint, ESR, has improved. After one month mycobacterial clearance in sputum smears was observed in 31.8% (p = 0.03) and 9.5% (p = 0.83) of patients on V7 and placebo. However, the difference between outcomes in two arms was below significance threshold (p = 0.07). Thus, larger population of patients with prolonged follow-up is required to support these preliminary findings.",
"The clinical effectiveness of Hydroxyurea in thalassemia is still controversial. The present paper puts together the authors' experience in two groups of patients with thalassemia intermedia and sickle cell/beta-thalassemia treated with varying dosages of hydroxyurea over several months. A third group received hydroxyurea along with recombinant human erythropoietin. Our observations are summarized in that treatment with hydroxyrea results in a significant increase of fetal hemoglobin with no change of the total hemoglobin levels. The drug causes also a considerable increase of the erythrocyte volume and hemoglobin content while the MCHC values remain unchanged. As a rule, and without objective criteria so far, patients state feeling better and having more energy. The authors postulate that this feeling may reflect the significant decrease of ineffective erythropoiesis resulting by the replacement of the poorly hemoglobinized, prematurely dying erythroid progenitor and red cell population by another population of cells with higher hemoglobin content and longer survival, the regeneration of which requires less energy and consumption. As expected, patients with sickle cell/beta-thalassemia have also fewer crises and painful episodes. The above findings are in keeping with the few available reports in the literature.",
"Metoclopramide is a well-known anti-emetic drug with central and peripheral pharmacological effects. Some authors have reported metoclopramide as an adjunct therapy to other analgesics in patients with migraine attacks. Treatment of migraine headache using a mix of metoclopramide and an NSAID has been patented (European Patent EP1014961) as well as a short series showing great efficacy and tolerability of metoclopramide in patients wtih migraine attacks. We decided to conduct an open, single-blind, parallel control study in the emergency department to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of metoclopramide in patients with severe migraine attacks. 93 consecutive patients with severe migraine attacks were randomized into two groups (groups A and B). Patients in group A received 10mg of intravenous metoclopramide and patients in group B received 1 g of intravenous paracetamol. Patients were evaluated 5 minutes before (baseline), 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after drug delivery, and before being discharged from the emergency department They were then contacted by phone 48 hours after being discharged from the hospital (phone questionnaire). Patients treated with either metoclopramide or paracetamol showed a significant reduction in the intensity of pain at the 120 minute time point, with an 86% and 82% improvement respectively. However, patients treated with metoclopramide showed a more rapid improvement at the 15 and 30 minute evaluations. Patients with severe migraine attacks treated with metoclopramide as monotherapy showed a significant improvement in terms of pain relief and a faster improvement in pain intensity compared to those treated with paracetamol. Metoclopramide and other dopamine antagonistic drugs should be considered a therapeutic option in severe migraine headache attacks.",
"The objective of this study was to review the efficacy and safety of frovatriptan (F) versus rizatriptan (R), zolmitriptan (Z) and almotriptan (A), in women with menstrually related migraine (IHS criteria) through a pooled analysis of three individual studies. Subjects with a history of migraine with or without aura were randomized to F 2.5 mg or R 10 mg (study 1), F or Z 2.5 mg (study 2), and F or A 12.5 mg (study 3). The studies had an identical multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover design. After treating three episodes of migraine in no more than 3 months with the first treatment, patients had to switch to the next treatment for other 3 months. 346 subjects formed intention-to-treat population of the main study; 280 of them were of a female gender, 256 had regular menses and 187 were included in the menstrual migraine subgroup analysis. Rate of pain free at 2, 4 and 24 h was 23, 52 and 67 % with F and 30, 61 and 66 % with comparators (P = NS). Pain relief episodes at 2, 4 and 24 h were 37, 60 and 66 % for F and 43, 55 and 61 % for comparators (P = NS). Rate of recurrence was significantly (P < 0.05) lower under F either at 24 h (11 vs. 24 % comparators) or at 48 h (15 vs. 26 % comparators). Number of menstrual migraine attacks associated with drug-related adverse events was equally low (P = NS) between F (5 %) and comparators (4 %).",
"The authors present a pilot study in which 20 patients with simple rib fractures were randomized prospectively into two treatment groups. One group received ibuprofen and the other group ibuprofen plus a rib belt for analgesia. There were no statistically significant differences observed in pulmonary function testing between the groups at initial visit, 48 hours, or 5 days. Atelectasis developed in four patients, two in each treatment group; there were no cases of pneumonitis. Patients with displaced rib fractures experienced a higher rate of hemo- or pneumothorax than did those with nondisplaced fractures (5/10 v 1/10). Patients with displaced fractures who used rib belts experienced a higher rate of hemothorax than those using oral analgesia alone (4/6 v 1/4). Patients using rib belts uniformly reported a significant amount of additional pain relief. The clinician can use a rib belt to provide additional comfort to the patient with fractured ribs without apparent additional compromise to respiratory parameters. A further study stratifying displaced and nondisplaced fractures has been initiated to clarify the possible contributing roles of displaced rib fractures and the rib belt in patients with displaced fractures.",
"The ability of tonabersat to relieve the symptoms of migraine attacks with or without aura was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel-group study. Patients received 20 or 40 mg of tonabersat, or 50 mg of sumatriptan (positive control), or placebo at the onset of a moderate or severe attack. Headache intensity, relief and recurrence were recorded for 24 h after dosing. On the basis of primary or secondary efficacy measures, tonabersat did not provide a clinically or statistically significant advantage over placebo. Tonabersat generally was well tolerated and had no effect on vital signs, electrocardiogram recordings or laboratory values. The lack of efficacy may be a function of the slow absorption of tonabersat. As a consequence of slow absorption, daily administration of tonabersat as prophylaxis for migraine attacks is under investigation in ongoing studies.",

Interpleural catheters were inserted through the 8th intercostal space in the remaining patients; 12 received local anaesthetic via the catheter immediately after surgery (Group 2) and 12 were given local anaesthetic at three hours (Group 3). Small asymptomatic pneumothoraces were noted on chest X-ray in six of the 24 patients with interpleural catheters. Both types of local anaesthesia produced lower pain scores than pethidine alone (P less than 0.05) with 25% of intercostal nerve blocks and 63% of interpleural catheters requiring no pethidine in the following three hours. The provision of catheter 'top-ups' between six and 18 hours after surgery also resulted in lower pain scores and a reduction in pethidine requirements (P less than 0.05).",

"The various drugs and methods studied in an attempt to curb the haemodynamic stress response associated with conventional laryngoscopic endotracheal intubation have not been found to be ompletely satisfactory. The rise in heart rate can be detrimental to patients with mitral stenosis. This study was aimed to compare the heart rate responses to endotracheal intubation using conventional laryngoscope and with the help of intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA) in patients with isolated mitral stenosis. Thirty-four adult patients of either sex, aged between 18 and 40 years with isolated mitral stenosis to undergo closed mitral commissurotomy were randomly allocated into two groups : Group A (n=17)- To be intubated using laryngoscopy. Group B (n=17)- To be intubated with the help of ILMA. The heart rate was recorded immediately preinduction, just prior to introducing the intubating device and postintubation every minute up to first 5 minutes. On applying statistical tests, it was found that the median heart rate values in group A at 2, 3, 4 and 5 minutes postintubation were significantly higher than in group B (p<0.05). Although use of both laryngosope and ILMA for endotracheal intubation was associated with rise in heart rate, the rise was less with ILMA compared to laryngoscope. Hence, it can be concluded that use of ILMA may be a preferable device for endotracheal intubation laryngoscopy in patients with isolated mitral stenosis.",

"Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) are associated with worse treatment outcomes for patients, including higher mortality, than for drug-sensitive tuberculosis. Delamanid (OPC-67683) is a novel anti-TB medication with demonstrated activity against multidrug-resistant disease. Patients who participated in the previously reported randomised, placebo-controlled trial of delamanid and the subsequent open-label extension trial were eligible to participate in a 24-month observational study designed to capture treatment outcomes. Treatment outcomes, as assessed by clinicians and defined by the World Health Organization, were categorised as favourable and unfavourable. Delamanid treatment groups were combined for analysis, based on their duration of treatment. In total, for 421 (87.5%) out of 481 patients from the original randomised controlled trial, consent was granted for follow-up assessments. Favourable outcomes were observed in 143 (74.5%) out of 192 patients who received delamanid for â¥6 months, compared to 126 (55%) out of 229 patients who received delamanid for â¤2 months. Mortality was reduced to 1.0% among those receiving long-term delamanid versus short-term/no delamanid (8.3%; p<0.001). Treatment benefit was also seen among patients with extensively drug-resistant TB. This analysis suggests that treatment with delamanid for 6 months in combination with an optimised background regimen can improve outcomes and reduce mortality among patients with both multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB.",

"We have treated 9 patients with sickle cell anemia (SS) with hydroxyurea (HU). All 9 patients carried 4 alpha-globin genes and the beta s-globin haplotypes 19/19 (Benin/Benin), except for 1 who had haplotype 19 together with type 3 (Benin/Senegal). Six patients received HU for 10 months and were again treated with the drug for 5 months after an interval of 1 year. One patient was given HU for 22 consecutive months. A record was kept of hematological and biochemical data, Hb F and G gamma levels, as well as possible clinical complications. Our data show that HU generally improves the hematological and biochemical values and the level of Hb F, and reduces painful crises in some patients. However, although the clinical symptoms improved in some patients during HU therapy, the older patients did not observe any changes in their general condition; the same is the case for the patient with haplotype 19/3. One patient also experienced life-threatening liver sequestration during treatment. We conclude that the selection of patients who may benefit from HU therapy needs further evaluation.",

"Periprocedural hyperglycemia is an independent predictor of mortality in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, periprocedural management of blood glucose is not standardized. The effects of routinely continuing long-acting glucose-lowering medications before coronary angiography with possible PCI on periprocedural glycemic control have not been investigated. Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM; nÂ = 172) were randomized to continue (Continue group; nÂ = 86) or hold (Hold group; nÂ = 86) their clinically prescribed long-acting glucose-lowering medications before the procedure. The primary end point was glucose level on procedural access. In a subset of patients (no DM group: nÂ = 25; Continue group: nÂ = 25; and Hold group: nÂ = 25), selected measures of platelet activity that change acutely were assessed. Patients with DM randomized to the Continue group had lower blood glucose levels on procedural access compared with those randomized to the Hold group (117 [97 to 151] vs 134 [117 to 172] mg/dl, pÂ = 0.002). There were two hypoglycemic events in the Continue group and none in the Hold group, and no adverse events in either group. Selected markers of platelet activity differed across the no DM, Continue, and Hold groups (leukocyte platelet aggregates: 8.1% [7.2 to 10.4], 8.7% [6.9 to 11.4], 10.9% [8.6 to 14.7], pÂ = 0.007; monocyte platelet aggregates: 14.0% [10.3 to 16.3], 20.8% [16.2 to 27.0], 22.5% [15.2 to 35.4], p <0.001; soluble p-selectin: 51.9Â ng/ml [39.7 to 74.0], 59.1Â ng/ml [46.8 to 73.2], 72.2Â ng/ml [58.4 to 77.4], pÂ =Â 0.014).

"Digoxin provides symptomatic relief in patients with systolic heart failure, yet it has potential proarrhythmic mechanisms and has not been formally studied in patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy-defibrillators (CRT-Ds). We evaluated the association between digoxin use and appropriate tachyarrhythmia therapy in patients with CRT-D with advanced heart failure, analyzing the incidence of appropriate device therapies and overall survival in 350 consecutive primary prevention recipients with CRT-D with baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) â¤35%, non-right bundle-branch block native QRS complex â¥120 ms, New York Heart Association III to IV heart failure, and significant coronary artery disease. Digoxin was prescribed in 162 patients (46%) at discharge from CRT-D implant. Over 48 Â± 32 months of follow-up, 59 patients (17%) received â¥1 appropriate shock. Digoxin therapy was associated with shorter time to first shock in intention-to-treat (corrected hazard ratio 2.18, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 3.87, p = 0.007) and on-treatment analysis (corrected hazard ratio 2.27, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 4.07, p = 0.006). Patients prescribed digoxin had a lower baseline LVEF, and digoxin therapy was associated with increased risk of shocks only in patients with LVEF <22% (median); there was no increased risk in patients with LVEF â¥22%. Overall survival and incidence of antitachycardia pacing were similar regardless of digoxin therapy. In conclusion, digoxin therapy is associated with increased likelihood of appropriate CRT-D shocks for rapid ventricular arrhythmias in primary prevention patients with coronary artery disease, and this risk appears to be most evident in patients with more severe baseline LV dysfunction. Digoxin use should be reexamined prospectively in patients with CRT-D.",
"Hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated 4 (HCN4) channels comprise the final pathway for autonomic heart rate (HR) regulation. We hypothesized that HCN4 inhibition could reverse autonomic imbalance in a human model of cardiac sympathetic activation. Nineteen healthy men ingested oral metoprolol+reboxetine, ivabradine+reboxetine, or placebo+reboxetine in a double-blind, randomized, crossover fashion. We assessed HR, blood pressure (BP), stroke volume, and cardiac output during rest and profound orthostatic stress. HR variability, BP variability, and baroreflex sensitivity were analyzed. Metoprolol, but not ivabradine, decreased resting HR and BP. Ivabradine attenuated the HR increase to orthostatic stress, albeit to a lesser extent than metoprolol. Stroke volume and cardiac output at a given HR were significantly lower with metoprolol. Unlike metoprolol, ivabradine did not affect HR variability, BP variability, or baroreflex sensitivity. Ivabradine attenuates sympathetic influences on HR at the sinus node level, leaving myocardial sympathetic activation unopposed. Reversal of parasympathetic dysfunction by ivabradine appears limited.",

"This study investigated the association of copper and zinc levels in the serum or urine of patients living in northeast China, with either prediabetes or diabetes. From January 2010 to October 2011, patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D, n = 25), type 2 diabetes (T2D, n = 137), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, n = 12) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n = 15), and age/gender matched controls (n = 50) were enrolled. In the T2D group, there were 24 patients with nephropathy, 34 with retinopathy, and 50 with peripheral neuropathy. Serum copper levels were significantly higher in IFG, IGT, and T2D groups. Serum zinc level was dramatically lower, and urinary zinc level was significantly higher in both T1D and T2D subjects compared with controls. The serum zinc/copper ratio was significantly lower in all the patients with IFG, ITG, T1D, and T2D. The serum copper level was positively associated with HbA1c in T2D subjects. Simvastatin treatment in T2D patients had no significant effect on serum and urinary copper and zinc. These results suggest the need for further studies of the potential impact of the imbalanced serum copper and zinc levels on metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and diabetic complications.",

"Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) is increasingly used to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality in children and pregnant women. The efficacy of IPT depends on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antimalarial drugs used. Healthy adult male volunteers whose occupation put them at high risk of malaria on the Northwest border of Thailand were randomized to receive a 3-day-treatment dose of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine monthly (DPm) or every 2 months (DPalt) or an identical placebo with or without fat (6.4 g/dose) over a 9-month period. All volunteers were monitored weekly. One thousand adults were recruited. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was well tolerated. There were 114 episodes of malaria (49 Plasmodium falciparum, 63 P. vivax, and 2 P. ovale). The protective efficacy against all malaria at 36 weeks was 98% (95% confidence interval [CI], 96% to 99%) in the DPm group and 86% (95% CI, 81% to 90%) in the DPalt group (for both, P < 0.0001 compared to the placebo group). As a result, the placebo group also had lower hematocrits during the study (P < 0.0001). Trough plasma piperaquine concentrations were the main determinant of efficacy; no malaria occurred in participants with a trough concentration above 31 ng/ml. Neither plasma piperaquine concentration nor efficacy was influenced by the coadministration of fat. DPm is safe to use and is effective in the prevention of malaria in adult males living in an area where P. vivax and multidrug-resistant P. falciparum malaria are endemic.",

"It has been shown that the clinical course of sickle cell (SS) patients can be ameliorated by administration of hydroxyurea (HU). Induction of hemoglobin F (HbF) is thought to be the mechanism responsible for clinical improvement in some patients. However, HU has a variable effect on HbF production and there exists no good correlation between the extent of HbF increase and clinical response. On the other hand, the degree of adherence of SS to vascular endothelium and neutrophil counts correlate well with clinical severity. Being a cytotoxic drug, used in myeloproliferative diseases, HU may alter proliferation among various cell lines. Moreover, HU has been reported to reduce red blood cell (RBC) adhesion receptor expression in young SS individuals and induces changes in endothelial cells in vitro. It should be conceived that in addition to its effects on HbF production, HU may change the clinical symptoms of SS patients by affecting the degree of adherence of different blood cells, by influencing the activity of endothelium as well as the activity of white blood cells (WBC) and platelets. To analyze whether several of the determinants of adhesion are modulated by HU treatment we studied the levels of endothelial activity (soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1, (sVCAM-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), fibronectin, neutrophil activity (sL-selectin, sIL-6 receptor-alpha, myeloperoxidase) and platelet activity (von Willebrand factor) in relation to clinical symptoms, hematological data and HbF levels in 8 SS patients before and during 5 months of HU therapy. Steady state sVCAM-1 levels are increased compared to normal controls and a significant decrease is noted during HU treatment, suggesting a decrease in the interactions between RBC and vascular endothelium. The IL-8 levels are comparable to those in normal controls and remain unaffected by HU therapy. Intercurrent infection and crises reveal striking increases in IL-8 which are accompanied by leukocytosis, but otherwise the IL-8 levels do not correlate with hematological data. HU has no demonstrable effect on fibronectin or soluble neutrophil adhesion molecules, but the levels of myeloperoxidase decrease significantly while WBC counts do not, implying a reduction in neutrophil activity which may help attenuate the propagation phase of a vasoocclusive crisis.",
"A multicenter study was conducted to assess the efficacy of a generic form of Atorvastatin (Ranbaxy's Storvas) in the treatment of Primary Hypercholesterolemia. One hundred and nineteen patients were given 10 mg of Storvas for four weeks and increased to 20 mg if target LDL-Cholesterol was not achieved. LDL-Cholesterol was reduced by 36.6% at four weeks and 37.5% at eight weeks from baseline. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly reduced. There were no drug-related serious adverse events. We conclude that the generic atorvastatin is safe and effective in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolaemia and the results are comparable to published data on innovator atorvastatin.",

"We assessed the impact of aspiration thrombectomy (AT) in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) on major adverse cardiac events at 30 days and 1-year mortality in 517 consecutive patients who were included in the prospective, nationwide, multicenter, observational Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey in 2010. Two hundred seventeen patients (42%) underwent AT (AT-PPCI) and 300 patients conventional (C) PPCI. Both groups had similar infarct-related artery distribution and ostial or proximal culprit lesion. Patients in AT-PPCI versus C-PPCI had lower systolic blood pressure and worse Killip class on admission, more frequent Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 0 or 1 before PPCI (80% vs 56%), less frequent restoration of flow after indwelling a guidewire in the infarct-related artery (32% vs 52%), and more use of IIb/IIIa glycoprotein inhibitors (69% vs 49%), respectively (p â¤0.05 for all comparisons). Thirty-day major adverse cardiac events was similar in the AT-PPCI and C-PPCI groups, 10.6% versus 9.7%, p = 0.73; adjusted odds ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.45 to 2.10, p = 0.95. One-year mortality was lower in the AT-PPCI versus C-PPCI group, 3.7% versus 6.7%, p = 0.13; adjusted hazard ratio 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.96, p = 0.042. In conclusion, this study of consecutive patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing PPCI demonstrates that AT was an independent predictor of reduced 1-year mortality.",

"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes have been investigated because of their crucial role in the defense against pathogens and their high degree of polymorphism. We performed a case-control study to assess a genetic association of MHC genes with susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB).

"Chagas cardiomyopathy is an endemic disease in Latin America. A significant proportion of patients develop atrial fibrillation (AF), which may result in stroke and increased morbidity or mortality. Interatrial block (IAB) has been associated with the development of AF in different clinical scenarios. The aim of our study was to determine whether IAB can predict new-onset AF in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). We conducted a retrospective study of patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and ICDs from 14 centers in Latin America. Demographics, clinical, and device follow-up were collected. Surface electrocardiograms were scanned at 300 dpi and maximized Ã8. Semiautomatic calipers were used to determine P-wave onset and offset. Partial IAB was defined as a P wave of >120 ms and advanced IAB as a P wave of >120 ms with biphasic morphology (Â±) in inferior leads. AF events and ICD therapies were reviewed during follow-up by 2 independent investigators. A total of 80 patients were analyzed. Mean age was 54.6 Â± 10.4 years, and 52 (65%) were male. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 40 Â± 12%. IAB was detected in 15 patients (18.8%), with 8 (10.0%) partial and 7 (8.8%) advanced. During a follow-up of 33 Â± 20 months, 11 patients (13.8%) presented with new AF. IAB (partial + advanced) was strongly associated with new AF (p <0.0001) and inappropriate therapy by the ICD (p = 0.014). In conclusion, IAB (partial + advanced) predicted new-onset AF in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and ICDs.",

"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death. Safflower attracts great attention owing to its anti-ischemia/reperfusion injury effect. Ninety-three patients with CAD were included and randomized into safflower treatment group, PCI group and control group. Low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) was performed to measure end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic volume (EDV), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and wall motion score index (WMSI) to determine the recovery of hibernating myocardium and cardiac function in all patients before treatment and after 3-month follow-up. The study was to investigate the effects of safflower on hibernating myocardial revascularization and cardiac function. It was found that LVEF was significantly improved, while the ESV and WMSI were significantly reduced after 2-week treatment in safflower and PCI treatment groups. No significant differences were found between safflower and PCI treatment groups in ESV, EDV, WMSI and LVEF after treatment Safflower injection effectively improved hibernating myocardial function.",

We conducted a double-blind, controlled trial with 5- to 12-y-old school children from 2 rural communities in northern Ghana (n = 241). Eligible children were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups to receive either cowpea meal fortified with 10 mg Fe/meal as NaFeEDTA, or an identical but nonfortified cowpea meal. Meals were provided 3 d/wk for a period of ~7 mo under strict supervision. Mass deworming and malaria antigenemia screening and treatment were carried out at baseline and 3.5 mo into the trial. Consumption of cowpea flour fortified with NaFeEDTA resulted in improvement of hemoglobin (P < 0.05), serum ferritin (P < 0.001), and body iron stores (P < 0.001) and reduction of transferrin receptor (P < 0.001) compared with nonfortified flour. Fortification resulted in a 30 and 47% reduction in the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) (P < 0.05), respectively. The results indicate that fortification of cowpea flour with NaFeEDTA overcomes the combined inhibitory effect of PA and PP and, when used for targeted school-based fortification of cowpea flour, is effective in reducing the prevalence of ID and IDA among school children in malaria endemic rural northern Ghana.",

"Refractory hypertension is an extreme phenotype of antihypertensive treatment failure. Participants in the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study, a large (n=30 239), population-based cohort were evaluated to determine the prevalence of refractory hypertension and associated cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. Refractory hypertension was defined as uncontrolled blood pressure (systolic/diastolic, â¥140/90 mm Hg) on â¥5 antihypertensive drug classes. Participants with resistant hypertension (systolic/diastolic, â¥140/90 mm Hg on â¥3 or <140/90 mm Hg on â¥4 antihypertensive classes) and all participants treated for hypertension served as comparator groups. Of 14 809 REGARDS participants receiving antihypertensive treatment, 78 (0.5%) had refractory hypertension. The prevalence of refractory hypertension was 3.6% among participants with resistant hypertension (n=2144) and 41.7% among participants on â¥5 antihypertensive drug classes. Among all participants with hypertension, black race, male sex, living in the stroke belt or buckle, higher body mass index, lower heart rate, reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria, diabetes mellitus, and history of stroke and coronary heart disease were associated with refractory hypertension. Compared with resistant hypertension, prevalence ratios for refractory hypertension were increased for blacks (3.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.68-5.37) and those with albuminuria (2.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-3.52) and diabetes mellitus (2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-3.31).

"Only a few series of pediatric tuberculosis (TB) have been reported in the last 20 years. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical, radiological, microbiological, and treatment characteristics of childhood TB. A total of 539 children with childhood TB diagnosed over a 12-year period (1994-2005) in 16 different centers in Turkey participated in the study. The medical records of all childhood TB patients were investigated. A total of 539 children (274 males, 265 females) with childhood TB aged 10 days-17 years participated in the study. Age distribution was nearly equal among all age groups. We detected the index case in 39.8% of the patients. More than one index case was detected in 17.3% of the patients. A minimum 15-mm induration is accepted on tuberculin skin test (TST) following Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccination. The TST was positive in 55.3% of the patients. Acid-fast bacillus smear was positive in 133, and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive in 45 patients. In 75 patients (13.9%), cultures yielded M. tuberculosis. One hundred fifty-one patients (28%) did not present for followup, and families of 5 patients (0.9%) discontinued the treatment. Pulmonary TB (n=285) and meningeal TB (n=85) were the most frequent diseases. In 29% of the patients, there was poor adherence to treatment or patients were lost to follow-up. We have demonstrated that household contact screening procedures play a major and important role, especially considering the high ratio of cases with contact index cases. We also recommend that the positive TST values should be reviewed according to the local cut-off data and should be specified in as many countries as possible. In view of the considerably high percentages of patients lost to follow-up and treatment discontinuation observed in our study, we suggest that application of directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) is preferable.",

"This is the first study to evaluate the efficacy of riboflavin for migraine prophylaxis in children. This was a randomized, double-blind study of riboflavin (200 mg daily) versus placebo in 48 children. The primary efficacy measure was the number of patients achieving a 50% or greater reduction in the number of migraine attacks per 4 weeks. Other outcome measures were the mean severity of migraine per day, mean duration of migraine, days with nausea or vomiting, analgesic use, and adverse effects. A 50% or greater reduction in headaches was seen in 14/21 patients in the placebo group and 12/27 patients in the riboflavin group (not significant P = .125). There were no differences between riboflavin and placebo for primary or secondary outcome variables. These results suggest that riboflavin is not an effective therapy for preventing migraine in children. A high placebo responder rate was seen, with implications for other studies of migraine in children.",

"In the absence of clinical trials, positive end-expired pressure (PEEP) has been accepted as efficacious for treatment of postoperative decreases in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) from a variety of causes including adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). PEEP is thought to increase PaO2 by alveolar recruitment, which in turn, has been hypothesized to play a decisive role in pulmonary recovery. One hundred and eighteen patients were followed prospectively, and after development of decreased PaO2, randomized to receive recruitive PEEP (determined by blood gas criteria) or supportive PEEP (the minimal PEEP required to maintain PaO2 above 60 mm Hg on .5 inspired O2 fraction (FIO2). No prognostic factors were significantly different between the two groups. Recruitive PEEP application in 22 patients yielded a significantly increased incidence of hypotension (55 percent), pneumothorax (20 percent), and death during treatment (27 percent) when compared to the 28 supportive PEEP patients who had no hypotension or pneumothorax and only one death during treatment (4 percent). After PEEP treatment, deaths in each group were similar (19 percent and 15 percent, respectively). We find no evidence that PEEP treatment promotes beneficial outcomes and conclude that recruitment attempts may be harmful.",
"Among patients who received a background drug regimen plus 100 mg of delamanid twice daily, 45.4% had sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth at 2 months, as compared with 29.6% of patients who received a background drug regimen plus placebo (P=0.008). Likewise, as compared with the placebo group, the group that received the background drug regimen plus 200 mg of delamanid twice daily had a higher proportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion (41.9%, P=0.04). The findings were similar with assessment of sputum-culture conversion in solid medium. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and were evenly distributed across groups.

"Co-morbid physical illness has been suggested to play an important role among the factors contributing to treatment resistance in patients with major depressive disorder. In the current study we compared the rate of physical co-morbidity, defined by ICD-10, among a large multicenter sample of 702 patients with major depressive disorder. A total of 356 of the participants were defined as treatment resistant depression (TRD) patients-having failed two or more adequate antidepressant trials. No significant difference was found between TRD and non-TRD participants in the prevalence of any ICD-10 category. This finding suggests that although physical conditions such as diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and peptic diseases are often accompanied by co-morbid MDD, they do not necessarily have an impact on the course of MDD or the likelihood to respond to treatment. Marginally higher rates of co-morbid breast cancer, migraine and glaucoma were found among TRD participants. Possible explanations for these findings and their possible relation to TRD are discussed.",

"A safe and reproducible Plasmodium vivax infectious challenge method is required to evaluate the efficacy of malaria vaccine candidates. Seventeen healthy Duffy (+) and five Duffy (-) subjects were randomly allocated into three (A-C) groups and were exposed to the bites of 2-4 Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium vivax derived from three donors. Duffy (-) subjects were included as controls for each group. Clinical manifestations of malaria and parasitemia were monitored beginning 7 days post-challenge. All Duffy (+) volunteers developed patent malaria infection within 16 days after challenge. Prepatent period determined by thick smear, was longer for Group A (median 14.5 d) than for Groups B and C (median 10 d/each). Infected volunteers recovered rapidly after treatment with no serious adverse events. The bite of as low as two P. vivax-infected mosquitoes provides safe and reliable infections in malaria-naive volunteers, suitable for assessing antimalarial and vaccine efficacy trials.",

"The aim of the study was to assess whether trimetazidine (TMZ) could affect dispersion of atrial depolarization and ventricular repolarization. Corrected QT interval (QTc), QTc dispersion (QTc-d), Tpeak-Tend, and Tpeak-Tend dispersion (Tpeak-Tend-d) were measured in 30 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) before and 6 months after randomization to conventional therapy plus TMZ (17 patients) or conventional therapy alone (13 patients). After 6 months, QTc was significantly reduced in both groups, whereas QT-peak was increased only in control group. Tpeak-Tend-d decreased (from 63.53 +/- 24.73 to 42.35 +/- 21.07 milliseconds, P = .006) only in TMZ group. When subgrouped according to CHF etiology, only ischemic patients on TMZ showed Tpeak-Tend-d reduction (65.00 +/- 27.14 vs 36.67 +/- 11.55 milliseconds, P = .001 in ischemic patients; 60.00 +/- 20.00 vs 56.00 +/- 33.86 milliseconds, P = NS, in nonischemic).

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of sucrose on biomarkers of energy metabolism and utilization in migraineous females. A total of 16 participants (8 = Migraine, 8 = Non-migraine) at the mid-point of their menstrual cycle underwent a 15-h fast prior to ingesting 75 g sucrose dissolved in 175 g water. Blood sampling for the assessment of serum insulin, serum cortisol and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and plasma glucose was conducted upon arrival at 09:00 h and then at regular 15-min intervals across a 150-min experimental period. The results showed a significant alteration in serum insulin and plasma glucose following sucrose ingestion in the migraine and non-migraine groups. In addition, significant group differences were observed in the level of serum insulin, serum DHEAS, and the cortisol:DHEAS ratio with migraine participants on average recording a higher sucrose-induced serum insulin level and lower DHEAS level and cortisol:DHEAS ratio when group data was compared. It was concluded that while sucrose consumption may potentiate serum insulin in migraineurs this does not result in the development of sucrose-induced hypoglycemia in migraine or non-migraine participants.",

"Malignant pheochromocytomas have exhibited partial responses to treatments with 131-I metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and with chemotherapy. The authors combined these two therapeutic methods to determine if beneficial effects from each would be additive. Patients with documented malignant pheochromocytomas were recruited with the intent of administering 131-I MIBG in three substantial amounts of radioactivity at 3-month intervals followed by a year of chemotherapy in which cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, and vincristine were to be given in 21-day cycles. Six patients entered the protocol. After the 131-I MIBG treatments, three patients manifested declines in the presence of tumor (smaller tumor volume or abnormalities on bone and 131-I MIBG scans) and the function of tumor (decreased rate of normetanephrine excretion as the major index). Two patients completed at least 9 months of chemotherapy and showed further reductions in the presence and function of tumors and were classified as having partial responses. Progressive disease afflicted three of the other four subjects. Even though toxicity was minimal from 131-I MIBG, it was sufficient to force reduction in the dosages or duration of chemotherapy. A combination of 131-I MIBG treatments and chemotherapy produced additive effects in reducing malignant pheochromocytomas. Toxicity moderately curtailed the proposed chemotherapy protocol.",

"Chronic right ventricular apical (RVA) pacing can lead to an increased risk of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, but the acute effects of RVA pacing on left atrial (LA) function are not well known. Twenty-four patients with sick sinus syndrome and intact intrinsic atrioventricular conduction were included. All patients received dual-chamber pacemaker implants with the atrial lead in the right atrial appendage and the ventricular lead in the right ventricular (RV) apex. Transthoracic standard and strain echocardiography (measured by tissue Doppler imaging and speckle tracking image) were performed to identify functional changes in the left ventricle (LV) and LA before and after 1Â hour of RVA pacing. The LA volume index did not change after pacing; however, the ratio of peak early diastolic mitral flow velocity (E) to peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity (Ea) was significantly increased and peak systolic LA strain (Sm), mean peak systolic LA strain rate (SmSR), peak early diastolic LA strain rate (EmSR), and peak late diastolic LA strain rate (AmSR) were significantly reduced after RV pacing. LV dyssynchrony, induced by RV pacing, had a significant correlation with E/Ea, Sm, and SmSR after pacing. E/Ea also had a negative correlation with Sm and SmSR after pacing. Multivariate regression analysis identified LV dyssynchrony and E/Ea as important factors that affect Sm, SmSR, EmSR, and AmSR after acute RVA pacing. Acute RVA pacing results in LA functional change and LV dyssynchrony and higher LV filling pressures reflected by E/Ea are important causes of LA dysfunction after acute RVA pacing.",
"There are two reasons for screening contacts: one is to identify cases of secondary tuberculosis disease (TB) and the other is to identify new cases of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma-release assay (IGRA) have their limitations when used for the detection of LTBI. They neither allow a definite diagnosis of LTBI nor provide information as to the date of onset. The present study was observational, multi-centre (four centers) and retrospective. Six hundred and one contacts were included. The results of the QFT test showed 88Â positive (15Â %). Among the 144Â index cases, all presented with pulmonary disease and 89Â cases were sputum positive. In our series, 101Â contacts belonged to the family circle. The four factors that had a significant positive impact on the result of the QFT test were: increasing age, the region of birth of the contact (high incidence areas), both of which may indicate old infection, while contact within the family and sputum positivity of the index case probably indicate recent infection. Only sputum positivity influenced the decision to treat the LTBI. We propose a tool aimed at facilitating the decision making process in QFT positive cases. Estimation of the duration of LTBI should help the physician to decide on the need for preventative treatment as well as a search for factors that increase the risk of progression to TB disease.",

"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has become a lethal global threat. Insights into the immune regulation of MDR-TB are urgently needed for the development of new treatments; however, the T cell response to an MDR-TB infection in human remains unclear. In the present study, the proportion of Th1 and Th2 cell subsets and the level of related T cell subset cytokines in peripheral blood were investigated. We detected that an MDR-TB infection resulted in suppressed Th1 and Th2 cell activation, which was more remarkable in patients with MDR-TB than that in drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) sufferers when compared to healthy controls (HCs). In addition, MDR-TB infection down-regulated the expression of IFN-Î³, IL-2, and IL-10, and up-regulated IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-Î± expression. Our data suggest that the disturbance between protective and pathogenic effects induced by the immunosuppression of Th1- and Th2-type responses is a substantial characteristic of MDR-TB infections.",

"Deferasirox is a once-daily, oral iron chelator developed for treating transfusional iron overload. Preclinical studies indicated that the kidney was a potential target organ of toxicity. As patients with sickle cell disease often have abnormal baseline renal function, the primary objective of this randomised, open-label, phase II trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of deferasirox in comparison with deferoxamine in this population. Assessment of efficacy, as measured by change in liver iron concentration (LIC) using biosusceptometry, was a secondary objective. A total of 195 adult and paediatric patients received deferasirox (n = 132) or deferoxamine (n = 63). Adverse events most commonly associated with deferasirox were mild, including transient nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and skin rash. Abnormal laboratory studies with deferasirox were occasionally associated with mild non-progressive increases in serum creatinine and reversible elevations in liver function tests. Discontinuation rates from deferasirox (11.4%) and deferoxamine (11.1%) were similar. Over 1 year, similar dose-dependent LIC reductions were observed with deferasirox and deferoxamine. Once-daily oral deferasirox has acceptable tolerability and appears to have similar efficacy to deferoxamine in reducing iron burden in transfused patients with sickle cell disease.",
"It is unknown whether left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) diagnosis by electrocardiography improves risk stratification in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We investigated the prognostic impact of LVH diagnosis by electrocardiography in a large sample of anticoagulated patients with AF included in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy (RE-LY) Study. We defined electrographic LVH (ECG-LVH) by strain pattern or Cornell voltage (R wave in aVL plus S wave in V3) >2.0 mV (women) or >2.4 mV (men). LVH prevalence was 22.7%. During a median follow-up of 2.0 years, 303 patients developed a stroke, 778 died (497 from cardiovascular causes), and 140 developed a myocardial infarction. LVH was associated with a greater risk of stroke (1.99% vs 1.32% per year, hazard ratio [HR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 to 1.93, p <0.001), cardiovascular death (4.52% vs 1.80% per year, HR 2.56, 95% CI 2.14 to 3.06, p <0.0001), all-cause death (6.03% vs 3.11% per year, HR 1.95, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.26, p <0.0001), and myocardial infarction (1.11% vs 0.55% per year, HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.92, p <0.0001). In multivariate analysis, the prognostic value of LVH was additive to CHA2DS2-VASc score and other covariates. The category-free net reclassification index and integrated discrimination improvement increased significantly after adding LVH to multivariate models. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that ECG-LVH, a simple and easily accessible prognostic indicator, improves risk stratification in anticoagulated patients with AF.",

"Hydroxyurea, a widely used cytotoxic/cytostatic agent that does not influence methylation of DNA bases, increases fetal hemoglobin production in anemic monkeys. To determine its effect in sickle cell anemia, we treated two patients with a total of four, 5-d courses (50 mg/kg per d, divided into three oral doses). With each course, fetal reticulocytes increased within 48-72 h, peaked in 7-11 d, and fell by 18-21 d. In patient I, fetal reticulocytes increased from 16.0 +/- 2.0% to peaks of 37.7 +/- 1.2, 40.0 +/- 2.0, and 32.0 +/- 1.4% in three successive courses. In patient II the increase was from 8.7 +/- 1.2 to 50.0 +/- 2.0%. Fetal hemoglobin increased from 7.9 to 12.3% in patient I and from 5.3 to 7.4% in patient II. Hemoglobin of patient I increased from 9.0 to 10.5 g/dl and in patient II from 6.7 to 9.9 g/dl. Additional single-day courses of hydroxyurea every 7-20 d maintained the fetal hemoglobin of patient I t 10.8-14.4%, and the total hemoglobin at 8.7-10.8 g/dl for an additional 60 d. The lowest absolute granulocyte count was 1,600/mm3; the lowest platelet count was 390,000/mm3. The amount of fetal hemoglobin per erythroid burst colony-forming unit (BFU-E)-derived colony cell was unchanged, but the number of cells per BFU-E-derived colony increased. Although examination of DNA synthesis in erythroid marrow cells in vitro revealed no decreased methylcytidine incorporation, Eco RI + Hpa II digestion of DNA revealed that hypomethylation of gamma-genes had taken place in vivo after treatment. This observation suggests that hydroxyurea is a potentially useful agent for the treatment of sickle cell anemia and that demethylation of the gamma-globin genes accompanies increased gamma-globin gene activity.",

"Tonabersat is a novel putative migraine prophylactic agent with an unique stereospecific binding site in the brain. Tonabersat has been shown, in animal models, to inhibit experimentally induced cortical spreading depression, the likely underlying mechanism for migraine aura, and cerebrovascular responses to trigeminal nerve stimulation. The aim was to study the potential for tonabersat as a migraine preventive. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel group study recruited patients with migraine with and without aura experiencing between two and six migraine attacks per month. After a 1-month baseline they received tonabersat 20 mg daily for 2 weeks and 40 mg daily for a further 10 weeks. The primary end-point was the change in mean number of migraine headache days between the third month and the baseline period in the intention-to-treat population comparing the placebo (n = 65) and tonabersat (n = 58) groups. At the primary end-point there was a 1.0-day (95% confidence interval -0.33, 2.39; P = 0.14) difference in reduction in migraine days between tonabersat and placebo. There were 10 secondary efficacy end-points, of which two were statistically significant. In month 3 of treatment, the responder rate, defined as a 50% reduction in migraine attacks, was 62% for tonabersat and 45% for placebo (P < 0.05), and the rescue medication use was reduced in the tonabersat group compared with placebo by 1.8 days (P = 0.02). Placebo responses were particularly high for all end-points. At least one treatment-emergent adverse event was reported in the tonabersat group in 61% of patients compared with 51% in the placebo group; none was worrisome. Placebo responses were unexpectedly high in this trial, complicating straightforward interpretation of the study results. The good tolerability and promising efficacy results support further exploration of higher doses of tonabersat in larger controlled trials.",
"Authors evaluated the effects of selective adrenergic blockade by means of doxazosin on blood pressure in 48 patients operated on for pheochromocytoma by a multicenter retrospective study. Age, tumor size, surgical approach, and operative time were analyzed as predictive factors of intraoperative hypertensive crises. Forty-eight patients underwent adrenalectomy--four open surgery and 44 laparoscopic surgery--for pheochromocytoma of adrenal glands from 1998 to 2008 after preoperative administration of doxazosin. Perioperative cardiovascular status modifications and surgical medium- and long-term outcomes were analyzed. There was no mortality, conversion rate was 4.5 per cent, and morbidity rate was 8.3 per cent. Intraoperative hypertensive crises (180/90 mmHg or higher) were observed in 14.5 per cent (seven of 48) of patients and were treated pharmacologically with no aftermath. None of the examined variables influenced the occurrence of intraoperative hypertensive episodes. Postoperative hypotension (lower than 90/60 mmHg) was observed in four of 48 patients (8.3%) and was treated by crystalloids and hydrocortisone. In the surgical treatment of pheochromocytoma, the preoperative adrenergic blockade by doxazosin does not prevent intraoperative hypertensive crises. Nevertheless, in our series, they were of short duration and were not associated with major cardiovascular complications. Perioperative hemodynamic instability was managed by preoperative pharmacological treatment, allowing low morbidity.",

Considering crossover, intention to treat (ITT), and on-treatment (OT) analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed. For exercise testing 44 (RV: 25, BIV: 19), and for NT-proBNP 53 patients (RV: 29, BIV: 24) were included. The ITT analysis revealed significant differences in pVO2 [ANCOVA effect 2.83 mL/kg/min, confidence interval (CI) 0.83-4.91, P = 0.007], VO2AT (ANCOVA effect 2.14 mL/min/k, CI 0.14-4.15, P = 0.03), and VE/VCO2 (ANCOVA effect -5.46, CI -10.79 to -0.13, P = 0.04) favouring BIV randomization. The significant advantage in pVO2 persisted in OT analysis, while VO2AT and VE/VCO2 showed trends favouring BIV pacing. LogNT-proBNP did not differ between groups.

"This 12-week, randomized, double-masked study was designed to overcome potential shortcomings of previous trials. We enrolled 788 subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension treated with a beta-blocker for > or = 4 weeks before screening. After washout, 500 subjects with a baseline mean intraocular pressure (IOP) > or = 26 and < 37 mmHg were randomized to fixed combination latanoprost-timolol in the evening (n = 170), latanoprost monotherapy in the evening (n = 165), or timolol monotherapy in the morning (n = 165). At weeks 2, 6, and 12, each subject's IOP level was measured in triplicate at 8 AM (predose), 10 AM, and 4 PM in each eye. Adverse events were monitored throughout. The statistical superiority of the fixed combination for the 18 pairwise comparisons with the 2 monotherapies was evaluated (analysis of variance). RESULTS. The statistical superiority of the fixed combination was demonstrated at 7/9 time points versus latanoprost and 9/9 time points versus timolol. Mean diurnal IOP levels were similar at baseline but significantly lower with the fixed combination than with either monotherapy at weeks 6 and 12 (each p < 0.05). Patients treated with the fixed combination were significantly more likely than those treated with either monotherapy to reach prespecified percent IOP reductions at the upper thresholds and to achieve very low target diurnal IOP levels. All therapies were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS. Fixed combination latanoprost/timolol safely reduces IOP levels in patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, though only slightly more than does latanoprost monotherapy.",

"Intermittent preventive treatment in infancy (IPTi) entails routine administration of antimalarial treatment doses at specified times in at-risk infants. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SDX/PYR) is a combination that has been used as first-line IPTi. Because of limited pharmacokinetic data and suggestions that higher milligram/kilogram pediatric doses than recommended should be considered, we assessed SDX/PYR disposition, randomized to conventional (25/1.25 mg/kg of body weight) or double (50/2.5 mg/kg) dose, in 70 Papua New Guinean children aged 2 to 13 months. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, 28 days, and three time points randomly selected for each infant at 4 to 8 h or 2, 5, 7, 14, or 21 days. Plasma SDX, PYR, and N(4)-acetylsulfadoxine (NSX, the principal metabolite of SDX) were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Using population modeling incorporating hepatic maturation and cystatin C-based renal function, two-compartment models provided best fits for PYR and SDX/NSX plasma concentration profiles. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC(0-â)) was greater with the double dose versus the conventional dose of PYR (4,915 versus 2,844 Î¼g/day/liter) and SDX (2,434 versus 1,460 mg/day/liter). There was a 32% reduction in SDX relative bioavailability with the double dose but no evidence of dose-dependent metabolism. Terminal elimination half-lives (15.6 days for PYR, 9.1 days for SDX) were longer than previously reported. Both doses were well tolerated without changes in hemoglobin or hepatorenal function. Five children in the conventional and three in the double-dose group developed malaria during follow-up. These data support the potential use of double-dose SDX/PYR in infancy, but further studies should examine the influence of hepatorenal maturation in very young infants.",
"Nitric-oxide donor glyceryl-trinitrate (GTN) modulates cerebral and spinal regions that are involved in migraine and pain processing. We hypothesized that in migraineurs, the susceptibility to develop a migraine attack after GTN administration should parallel with an high sensitivity to GTN-induced change in the pain processing at spinal level. We used the temporal summation threshold (TST) of the lower limb nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) and the related pain sensation to study in parallel the time-course of the effect of the GTN administration on the pain processing at spinal level in migraine and healthy subjects. Twenty-eight (21 F; 7M; mean age 34.2 Â± 8.2) migraine and 15 (11 F; 4M; mean age 35.9 Â± 8.9) healthy subjects were recruited in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. Neurophysiological examinations were carried out before (baseline) and 30', 60', 120', 180' and 240' after GTN (0.9 mg sublingual) or placebo administration during two different sessions. In migraineurs, GTN administration was associated to a significant facilitation in temporal summation of pain (reduced TST and increased painful sensation) 60', 120' and 180' after drug intake when compared to baseline, to placebo condition and to controls after GTN intake. Furthermore, in migraineurs who developed migraine after GTN, a significant facilitation in temporal summation of pain was detected 60', 120' and 180' after drug intake when compared to patients without clinical response. In migraineurs the susceptibility to develop migraine attack after GTN administration seems to be a specific trait of a subgroup of patients linked to a supersensitivity of the pain system to GTN.",

"Maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR) is superior to rate control in atrial fibrillation (AF). In order to achieve SR, we administered single-dose intravenous amiodarone intraoperatively and evaluated its effect on conversion of rheumatic AF to SR in patients undergoing valvular heart surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to amiodarone (n = 42) or control (n = 40) group in a double blind manner. The amiodarone group received amiodarone (3 mg/kg) intravenously prior to the institution of cardiopulmonary bypass and the control group received the same volume of normal saline. In the amiodarone group, the initial rhythm after the release of aortic cross clamp was noted to be AF in 14.3% (n = 6) and remained so in 9.5% (n = 4) of patients till the end of surgery. In the control group, the rhythm soon after the release of aortic cross clamp was AF in 37.5% (n = 15) (p = 0.035) and remained so in 32.5% (n = 13) of patients till the end of surgery (p = 0.01). At the end of first post-operative day 21.4% (n = 9) of patients in amiodarone group and 55% (n = 22) of patients in control group were in AF (p = 0.002). The requirement of cardioversion/defibrillation was 1.5 (+/-0.54) in amiodarone group and 2.26 (+/-0.73) in the control group (p = 0.014), and the energy needed was 22.5 (+/-8.86) joules in the amiodarone group and 40.53 (+/-16.5) in the control group (p = 0.008). A single intraoperative dose of intravenous amiodarone increased the conversion rate of AF to normal sinus rhythm, reduced the need and energy required for cardioversion/defibrillation and reduced the recurrence of AF within one day.",

"Malaria parasites interact with the host cell membrane inserting new proteins and inducing oxidative and phosphorylative changes of erythrocyte proteins. In the present report we monitored the time dependent oxidative and phosphorylative modifications induced by parasites in heterozygous beta thalassemia (Het-Î²Thal). Het-Î²Thal causes mild anemia and is known to determine a pro-oxidant milieu and a protective effect against severe malaria. In malaria cultures Het-Î²Thal has been reported to induce accumulation of hemoglobin denaturation products. At early parasite development stages (rings), tyrosine hyper-phosphorylation of band 3 was the most notable modification, and at later development stages (trophozoites), additional membrane proteins displayed significant hyper-phosphorylation of their serine and tyrosine residues (adducins, ankyrin, catalase). Het-Î²Thal also caused membrane destabilization. Free radical scavengers effectively inhibited the phosphorylative response and membrane destabilization. Kinase inhibitors exerted similar effects suggesting a causal relationship between oxidative stress, membrane protein hyper-phosphorylation and increased membrane damage exacerbated by Het-Î²Thal. In conclusion, different lines of evidence suggest that Het-Î²Thal enhances the redox stress caused by malaria parasites inducing its protective effect destabilizing the host cell membrane.

"The mean follow-up period was 21+/-5 months, with the study drug discontinued prematurely in 696 of the 2301 patients (30.2%) receiving dronedarone and in 716 of the 2327 patients (30.8%) receiving placebo, mostly because of adverse events. The primary outcome occurred in 734 patients (31.9%) in the dronedarone group and in 917 patients (39.4%) in the placebo group, with a hazard ratio for dronedarone of 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.84; P<0.001). There were 116 deaths (5.0%) in the dronedarone group and 139 (6.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.08; P=0.18). There were 63 deaths from cardiovascular causes (2.7%) in the dronedarone group and 90 (3.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.98; P=0.03), largely due to a reduction in the rate of death from arrhythmia with dronedarone. The dronedarone group had higher rates of bradycardia, QT-interval prolongation, nausea, diarrhea, rash, and an increased serum creatinine level than the placebo group. Rates of thyroid- and pulmonary-related adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups.",
"The results of the present study do not support the idea of a generalised increase in NO synthase activity in migraine patients outside of a migraine attack. The smaller increase in plasma L-citrulline, urinary nitrate and cGMP excretion following L-arginine infusion in migraine patients might indicate dysfunction of endothelial NO synthase.",

"This study examined the intermittent exercise performance and cardiovascular health profile in elite female football players in comparison to untrained young women, as well as a subgroup subjected to football training 2x1 h Â· week(-1) for 16 weeks. Twenty-seven Danish national team players (elite trained, ET) and 28 untrained women (UT) underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-scanning (DXA), comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography, treadmill and Yo-Yo Intermittent Endurance level 2 (IE2) testing. Eight women in UT were also tested after the football training period. Maximal oxygen uptake rate (VO2max), peak ventilation and peak lactate were 40, 18 and 51% higher (P< 0.01) in ET than UT, respectively. Cardiac dimensions and function were greater in ET than UT, with left ventricular diastolic diameter, right ventricular diastolic diameter, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and peak transmitral flow in early diastole divided by peak transmitral flow velocity in late diastole during atrial contraction (E/A-ratio) being 13, 19, 27 and 41%, respectively, greater in ET than UT (P< 0.001 to< 0.05). Yo-Yo IE2 performance was 7-fold higher in ET than UT (1772 Â± 508 vs. 234 Â± 66 m, P< 0.001), fat mass was 51% lower (P< 0.001) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were 20% higher (P< 0.01). Sixteen weeks of football elevated VO2max and Yo-Yo IE2 performance by 16 and 40%, respectively, and lowered fat mass by 6%. Cardiac function was markedly improved by 16 weeks of football training with 26 and 46% increases in TAPSE and E/A ratio, respectively, reaching levels comparable to ET. In summary, elite female football players have a superior cardiovascular health profile and intermittent exercise performance compared to untrained controls, but short-term football training can markedly improve the cardiovascular health status.",
"For patients on multiple-drug therapy including a PGA, replacement of dorzolamide/timolol with brimonidine/timolol may help achieve a lower IOP, while replacement of brimonidine plus dorzolamide/timolol with brimonidine/timolol may help achieve as low an IOP with fewer medications.",

"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease affecting women. Following case reports that pregnancy exacerbates LAM, patients are frequently advised to avoid pregnancy. Our objective was to determine pregnancy and health outcomes in LAM to provide better evidence with which to council patients contemplating pregnancy. We surveyed 328 women with LAM regarding pregnancy outcomes, pulmonary function, subjective and psychological functioning, quality of life, dyspnoea and fatigue. Amongst childless women the main reason not to attempt pregnancy was based on concerns about potential effects of pregnancy on LAM. Almost two thirds of patients had been pregnant, the majority before LAM was diagnosed, in whom pregnancy outcome was generally favourable. Women diagnosed with LAM (n=15) during pregnancy had high rates of pneumothorax (67%), miscarriage (7%) and premature birth (47%). The group diagnosed with LAM before or during pregnancy (n=12) had lower mean FEV(1), FVC and DLCO after pregnancy compared with those diagnosed following pregnancy or never pregnant. There were no differences in subjective or psychological functioning, quality of life, dyspnoea or fatigue scores between groups. In newly diagnosed LAM patients there was a high incidence of premature birth and pneumothorax. These adverse outcomes may be a marker of aggressive LAM.",

"Linking appropriate case management for malaria to financial incentives has the potential to improve patient care and reduce wastage of expensive antimalarials. In our study facilities, on average only 25% of reported malaria cases were confirmed by laboratory diagnosis prior to the intervention, and the total treatment courses of antimalarials dispensed did not correspond to the number of cases reported. This study will demonstrate whether facility rather than individual incentives are compelling enough to improve case management, and whether these incentives lead to offsetting cost-savings as a result of reduced drug consumption.",

"The effects of statins on the prognosis of patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction remain controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of statin treatment on clinical outcomes in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with LV systolic dysfunction. A total of 5,119 AMI patients with LV ejection fraction less than 50% on the initial echocardiogram were analyzed in the Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry. The study population was divided into 4 groups according to the level of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and statin treatment: low hs-CRP (hs-CRP â¤ 2.0 mg/L) and high hs-CRP (hs-CRP > 2 mg/L) with or without statin therapy. We evaluated the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) including cardiac death, reinfarction, target lesion revascularization, and coronary artery bypass grafting during a 12-month period in each group. Statin therapy did not significantly prevent the MACEs in the low hs-CRP groups (with statin: 10.1% versus without statin: 12.0%, P = 0.249). In the high hs-CRP groups, however, the incidence of MACEs was significantly decreased with statin treatment (with statin: 11.3%, without statin: 20.8%, P < 0.001). These findings were consistently observed in all subgroups of the high-hs CRP group, including the subgroup with an LV ejection fraction less than 40%. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis of the high hs-CRP group, lack of statin therapy was a significant predictor of MACE incidence (odds ratio: 1.573, 95% confidence interval: 1.079-2.293, P = 0.018). The statin treatment was associated with better outcome in AMI and LV dysfunction patients with hs-CRP â¥ 2 mg/dL.",
"Our aim was to analyze any changes during diastole in patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), after pacemaker stimulation from the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and right ventricular apex (RVA) lead position. This was a prospective, randomized, follow up study, which lasted for 12 months. Our research included 132 consecutive patients who were implanted with a permanent antibradycardiac pacemaker. Regarding the right ventricle lead position the patients were divided into two groups: The RVOT group--71 patients, with right ventricle outflow tract lead position and the RVA group--61 patients, with right ventricle apex lead position. We measured LVEF and diastolic parameters: peak filling ratio and time to peak filling ratio obtained by radionuclide ventriculography (RNV). The LVEF and various diastolic parameters and left atrial diameter were obtained by echocardiography. Based on the values of deceleration time of early diastolic filling (DTE), and other diastolic parameters like left atrial diameter, all the patients were classified into three degrees of diastolic dysfunction. Our results showed that there was no group difference in distribution of gender, age, body mass index (BMI), VVI to DDD pacemakers implantation ratio, RNV parameters (LVEF, peak filling rate (PFR), time to PFR (TPFR)) and echocardiography parameters: LVEF and parameters of diastolic dysfunction. After 12 months of pacemaker stimulation, LVEF by RNV remained the same in the RVOT group 51.31Â±15.80% (P=0.75), and also in the RVA group 53.83Â±6.57%, (P=0.19). In the RVOT group the PFR was highly lower and this finding was significant (P=0.01), while TPFR was also significantly lower (P=0.03). By dividing the patients according to the degree of diastolic dysfunction we found that most patients in both groups at enrollment had a second degree diastolic dysfunction. In both groups diastolic dysfunction increased, the number of patients with third degree diastolic dysfunction increased, and the number of patients with second degree diastolic dysfunction decreased, however, the worsening of diastolic function was significant only in the RVOT group. In conclusion, pacemaker stimulation from RVOT, but not in RVA, leads to progression of diastolic dysfunction in patients with preserved LVEF. This negative effect of pacemaker stimulation from RVOT on diastolic parameters was confirmed by two independent methods, RNV and echocardiography.",
"A total of 12 537 participants with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine titrated to a fasting glucose of â¤ 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or standard glycaemic care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose â¤ 54 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose â¤ 36 mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke; (ii) mortality; (iii) CV mortality; and (iv) arrhythmic death. Hazards were estimated before and after adjustment for a hypoglycaemia propensity score. During a median of 6.2 years (IQR: 5.8-6.7), non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 41.7 and 14.4% glargine and standard group participants, respectively, while severe episodes occurred in 5.7 and 1.8%, respectively. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was not associated with any outcome following adjustment. Conversely, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a greater risk for the primary outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.02, P < 0.001), mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.19, P < 0.001), CV death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27-2.30, P < 0.001) and arrhythmic death (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.17-2.67, P = 0.007). Similar findings were noted for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia for the primary outcome and mortality. The severe hypoglycaemia hazard for all four outcomes was higher with standard care than with insulin glargine.",

"Levels of hs-TnT were measurable in 93.5% of patients; 75% had levels >7.5 ng/l, 50% had levels >11.0 ng/l, and 25% had levels >16.7 ng/l. During a median 1.9-year period, the annual rates of stroke or systemic embolism ranged from 0.87% in the lowest hs-TnT quartile to 2.13% in the highest hs-TnT quartile (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35 to 2.78; p = 0.0010). The annual rates in the corresponding groups ranged from 0.46% to 4.24% (adjusted HR: 4.31; 95% CI: 2.91 to 6.37; p < 0.0001) for cardiac death and from 1.26% to 4.21% (adjusted HR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.43 to 2.56; p = 0.0001) for major bleeding. Adding hs-TnT levels to the CHA2DS2VASc score improved the C statistic from 0.620 to 0.635 for stroke or systemic embolism (p = 0.0226), from 0.592 to 0.711 for cardiac death (p < 0.0001), and from 0.591 to 0.629 for major bleeding (p < 0.0001).

"At baseline, patients with two or more CMCs (n = 582; 58.0%) reported more severe anxiety symptoms (10.5 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 10.1-10.9] versus 9.5 [95% CI = 9.0-10.0], p = .003) and anxiety-related disability (17.6 [95% CI = 17.0-18.2] versus 16.0 [95% CI = 15.3-16.7], p = .001). However, their clinical improvement was comparable to that of patients with one or zero CMCs (predicted change in anxiety symptoms = -3.9 versus -4.1 at 6 months, -4.6 versus -4.4 at 12 months, -4.9 versus -5.0 at 18 months; predicted change in anxiety-related disability = -6.4 versus -6.9 at 6 months, -6.9 versus -7.3 at 12 months, -7.3 versus -7.5 at 18 months). The only specific CMC with a detrimental effect was migraine, which was associated with less improvement in anxiety symptoms at 18 months (predicted change = -4.1 versus -5.3).",

"Computed tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic radiofrequency ablation was performed for nine liver tumors of eight patients, which were located in the hepatic dome and undetectable by ultrasound (US). A total 11 sessions of ablation were performed. Complications were noted in five sessions (45%) and no complications were noted in six sessions (55%). Pneumothorax was noted in five sessions (45%), including two sessions (18%) with major pneumothorax requiring a chest tube. Major complications were seen in two sessions (18%), major pneumothorax and both major pneumothorax and moderate pleural effusion, respectively. CT-guided transthoracic radiofrequency ablation may be an alternative for treatments of liver tumor in the hepatic dome.",
"A field trial was conducted on the efficacy of Interceptor nets-a long-lasting insecticidal net (LLN) factory treated with alphacypermethrin 0.667% (w/w) corresponding to 200mg/m(2), against malaria vectors Anopheles culicifacies and Anopheles fluviatilis in one of the highly endemic areas of Orissa. The study area comprised 19 villages which were randomized into three clusters and designated as Interceptor net cluster, untreated net cluster, and no net cluster. Baseline studies showed that both the vector species An. culicifacies and An. fluviatilis were 100% susceptible to alphacypermethrin. Results of wash-resistance and bio-efficacy of Interceptor nets showed 100% mortality in An. culicifacies and An. fluviatilis even after 20 washings. Bioassays on the Interceptor nets while in use in the field conditions showed a knockdown effect on 70-90% mosquitoes during different months of intervention after 3 min of exposure and 100% mortality was recorded after 24h of recovery period. The median knockdown time for these species ranged between 4.10-5.25 min and 4.00-5.00 min respectively during intervention period. In Interceptor net study area, there was a significant reduction of 88.9, 96.3 and 90.6% in the entry rate of An. culicifacies, An. fluviatilis and other anopheline species respectively with an over all reduction of 87.5% in total mosquitoes. The overall feeding success rate of mosquitoes in the trial villages was only 12.8% in comparison to 35.0 and 78.8% in villages with untreated nets and no nets respectively. A significant reduction was also recorded in parity rate and human blood index of vector species in Interceptor net area. The results of the study showed that Interceptor nets are effective against the malaria vectors and may be used as a suitable intervention strategy in high-risk areas.",
"Malaria blood-stage vaccines are in an early phase of clinical development with MSP1 being a major antigen candidate. There are limited data on the protective efficacy of antibodies against subunits of MSP1 in the malaria endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa. This prospective cohort study was nested into a large insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) trial during which neonates were individually randomised to ITN protection from birth vs. protection from month six onwards in rural Burkina Faso. A sub sample of 120 children from three villages was followed for 10 months with six measurements of MSP1(42) antibodies (ELISA based on recombinant 42kDa fragment) and daily assessment of malaria episodes. Time to the next malaria episode was determined in relation to MSP1(42) antibody titres. MSP1(42) antibody titres were dependent on age, season, ITN-group, number of previous malaria episodes and parasitaemia. There were no significant differences in time until the next malaria episode in children with low compared to children with high MSP1(42) antibody titres at any point in time (101 vs. 97 days in May, p=0.6; 58 vs. 84 days in September, p=0.3; 144 vs. 161 days in March, p=0.5). The findings of this study support the short-lived nature of the humoral immune response in infants of malaria endemic areas. The study provides no evidence for antibodies against a subunit of MSP1 being protective against new malaria episodes in infants.",

"Most people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis have an asymptomatic condition named latent tuberculosis. These people do not have bacilli in the corporal secretions and are hard to diagnose by conventional laboratory tests. Diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in MÃ©xico is based on the tuberculin skin test (TST). This test has disadvantages, principally because the vaccine containing the Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) is applied to 99% of this population and causes false positive TST outcomes. Recently, interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) have been demonstrated to be a good test to detect latent tuberculosis with equal or better sensitivity to TST and without interference from BCG. However, in MÃ©xico the IGRA are an uncommon test due to the higher cost compared to TST. The main objective of this work was demonstrate the potential utility of the Quantiferon TB(Â®) gold in tube (QTB(Â®)-GIT) test to detect latent TB in a population from northern MÃ©xico. Samples from 106 subjects with close contact, or without contact, with actively infected TB patients were tested to detect LTBI. Our results show a significant difference between individuals in close contact with active TB patients (39.7%) compared to those without contact (3.2%), p < 0.01. The concordance between TST and QTB(Â®)-GIT was poor (Îº = 0.31). Our preliminary results show that the QTB(Â®)-GIT has better capacity than TST to detect latent tuberculosis infection.",

"Dabigatran etexilate is the orally bioavailable pro-drug of dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor. Using data from eight clinical studies in healthy volunteers and patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) or undergoing orthopaedic surgery (OS), population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) models were developed to investigate whether the PK and PD of dabigatran differ across different populations. In both healthy volunteers (n=80) and patients (n=1,965), the PK of dabigatran was best described by a two-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and elimination. Renal function was the only covariate shown to have a clinically relevant impact on dabigatran exposure. The patient PK model was successfully applied in predicting exposure observed in the RE-LY trial evaluating dabigatran treatment in patients with non-valvular AF. The relationship between dabigatran plasma concentrations and activated partial thromboplastin time in healthy volunteers and patients (n=762) was best described with a combination of a linear model and a maximum effect (Emax) model, consistent with previous reports. PK/PD relationships were robust across the various populations tested and were not affected by any of the covariates examined. In summary, the PK of dabigatran is sufficiently consistent to allow extrapolation of data generated in healthy volunteers to patients with AF or undergoing OS.",
"There are no pharmacokinetic grounds to deter co-administration of an MAOI-A and subcutaneous sumatriptan. The dominance of the distribution phase and completeness of absorption of a 6 mg dose of s.c. sumatriptan explains the trivial effect size of the MAOI-A on plasma sumatriptan concentrations. Importantly, these findings should not be extrapolated to other routes of administration for sumatriptan.",
"Malaria remains one of the world's greatest killers and a vaccine is urgently required. There are no established correlates of protection against malaria either for natural immunity to the disease or for immunity conferred by candidate malaria vaccines. The RTS,S/AS02A vaccine offers significant partial efficacy against malaria.mRNA expression of five key cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³), monokine induced by gamma (MIG), interleukin-10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor-Î² (TGF-Î²) and forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured by real-time RT-PCR before and after vaccination with RTS,S/AS02A and Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara encoding the circumsporozoite protein (MVA-CS) in healthy malaria-naÃ¯ve adult volunteers. The only significant change was in IFN-Î³ mRNA expression, which was increased seven days after vaccination (P â=â 0.04). Expression of MIG mRNA seven days after vaccination correlated inversely with time to detection of parasites by blood film in an experimental sporozoite challenge (r = 0.94 P â=â 0.005). An inverse relationship was seen between both TGF-Î²1 and IL-10 mRNA at baseline and the anti-circumsporozoite IgG antibody response (r â=â -0.644 P â=â 0.022 and r =â -0.554 P = 0.031 respectively). This study demonstrates the potential for MIG expression as a correlate of protection against malaria. Baseline levels of the regulatory cytokines TGF-Î² and IL-10 inversely correlated with antibody levels post vaccination and warrant further studies to improve understanding of individual differences in response to vaccination.",

"The relationships between changes in myocardial uptake of metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and those in circulating catecholamines and cardiac function after treatment of phaeochromocytoma and neuroblastoma were evaluated. Iodine-123 or iodine-131 MIBG scintigraphy was performed before and after surgical resection and/or chemotherapy for primary tumours in nine patients with phaeochromocytoma and 13 patients with neuroblastoma. Changes in myocardial MIBG uptake after treatment were estimated by the heart-to-upper mediastinum (H/M) uptake ratios on the images obtained 24 h after MIBG injection, which were compared with serum levels of noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A). Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography, with measurements of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Before treatment, eight patients with phaeochromocytoma and three with neuroblastoma showed poor myocardial MIBG uptake, with highly elevated circulating NA and A. Echocardiography, however, did not show cardiac dysfunction in these patients with the exception of two patients with phaeochromocytoma. With normalization of NA and A levels after treatment, all of these patients except for the two with persistent cardiac dysfunction showed restoration of myocardial MIBG uptake. The H/M ratios increased significantly after treatment in both patient groups, i.e. with phaeochromocytoma and with neuroblastoma (P<0.0001 and P<0.05, respectively), and these ratios correlated inversely with circulating NA and A before and after treatment. By contrast, there was no significant correlation between H/M ratios and LVEF in these two groups. These results indicate that suppression of myocardial MIBG uptake usually may not be related to cardiac dysfunction and may be reversible following normalization of excess catecholamine levels after treatment in patients with neuroadrenergic tumours. However, the suppression may persist in the presence of catecholamine-induced cardiac dysfunction. The assessment of myocardial MIBG uptake can be a helpful adjunct in monitoring the normalization of circulating catecholamine levels and also in identifying the presence of cardiac dysfunction in treated patients with neuroadrenergic tumours.",

"Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) is one of the most commonly administered vaccines worldwide. In addition to protection against tuberculosis (TB), evidence suggests that BCG immunisation has a number of additional beneficial non-specific immunological effects. These include a reduction in overall infant and child mortality attributable to causes other than TB in high-mortality regions. The antibody response to immunisations provides an opportunity to investigate the influence of BCG on the immune response to unrelated antigens. This study compared the antibody response to routine immunisations in BCG-immunised and non-BCG-immunised infants. BCG-immunised infants were recruited from a related study in which BCG was given at birth and non-BCG-immunised infants were recruited from immunisation clinics. All infants received their routine immunisations according to the Australian National Immunisation Program. Concentrations of antibodies against pneumococcal (anti-Pn Ps), Haemophilus influenzae type B (anti-Hib), tetanus toxoid (anti-TT) and hepatitis B surface (anti-HBs) antigen were measured four weeks after the last (six month) set of infant immunisations. A total of 127 parents agreed for their infants to take part in the study of which 108 were included in the final analysis (56 BCG-immunised and 52 non-BCG-immunised). The geometric mean concentration (GMC) of anti-Pn Ps IgG for all serotypes, anti-Hib IgG and anti-TT IgG were higher in the BCG-immunised group than the non-BCG-immunised group. This difference reached statistical significance for serotype 9V (p<0.01) and 18C (p=0.04). The GMC of anti-HBs IgG was lower in the BCG-immunised group than the non-BCG-immunised group (p=0.03). The majority of participants in both groups had antibody levels above the protective threshold. BCG immunisation at birth influences the antibody response to routine immunisations administered later in infancy. This has important implications for the introduction of both pneumococcal conjugate and novel TB vaccines in resource-limited countries.",
"Migraine headaches, a common chronic medical problem, require prophylactic treatment when they are frequent and severe. This is the first study to investigate the efficacy of Kiko, a Japanese practice of Qigong that uses repetitive coordinated breathing and movement as a prophylactic treatment of migraine headaches. This pilot study, a single arm, non-randomized 4-month trial, investigated whether 3 months of Kiko training would reduce the severity and/or frequency of migraine and/or MIDAS scores. The baseline migraine data were collected from participants in the first month and then participants were taught Kiko exercises in 3 monthly sessions. Participants practiced at home and had the opportunity to utilize a Kiko DVD. The participants were instructed by Washin-Ryu style martial arts Master, Hidy Ochiai. Subjects completed monthly diaries that recorded the frequency and severity of their migraines, as well as the frequency and duration of their home Kiko practice. Six of the original 13 subjects completed the trial. All the individuals who completed the study had measurable improvement in their migraines. All participants reported a positive experience in learning the technique, and there were no reported adverse effects. Although the results of this study need to be confirmed in a larger clinical trial with adequate controls for placebo effects, these preliminary results are consistent with other trials that have documented the potential benefits of mind-body practices in controlling symptoms and improving the quality of life of patients suffering from chronic medical illness.",

"It is difficult to identify the successful component(s) related to changes in metabolic syndrome (MetS) from lifestyle interventions: the weight loss, the behavior change, or the combination. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a weight-stable randomized controlled trial of low-fat diet and exercise, alone and in combination, on MetS. Men (n = 179) and postmenopausal women (n = 149) with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were randomized into a 1-year, weight-stable trial with four treatment groups: control (C), diet (D), exercise (E), or diet plus exercise (D+E). MetS was defined using a continuous score. Changes in MetS score (DeltaMetS) were compared between groups using analysis of covariance, stratified by gender and using two models, with and without baseline and change in percent body fat (DeltaBF) as a covariate. In men, DeltaMetS was higher for D vs. C (P = 0.04), D+E vs. C (P = 0.0002), and D+E vs. E (P = 0.02). For women, DeltaMetS was greater for D vs. C (P = 0.045), E vs. C (P = 0.02), and D+E vs. C (P = 0.004). After adjusting for DeltaBF, all differences between groups were attenuated and no longer significant. DeltaMetS were associated with DeltaBF for both men (P < 0.0001) and women (P = 0.004). After adjustment for DeltaBF, low-fat diet alone and in combination with exercise had no effect on MetS. The key component for MetS from low-fat diet and/or increased physical activity appears to be body fat loss.",

"This study was designed to determine if low doses of oral sodium phenylbutyrate (SPB) induce hemoglobin F (HbF) synthesis in children with hemoglobin SS (HbSS). We treated 8 children with HbSS over a period of 5-30 weeks. The initial dose (1.0 g/d) was increased weekly (by 1.0 g/d) until F-reticulocytes doubled. All patients showed an increase in F-reticulocytes (P = 0.002) that was dose-dependent (P = 0.001). Three of 5 patients who continued oral SPB for more than 10 weeks had substantial increases in HbF. We conclude that lower dose SPB is effective in inducing HbF synthesis in some children with HbSS. Further trials are warranted to determine the optimal treatment regimen.",
"Hydroxyurea may be the most promising drug suggested thus far as a treatment for patients with sickle cell anemia, but its safety and efficacy remain unproved, and it probably will not be evaluable for several years. It is not "the answer" for the disease, it seems likely that crises will not be eliminated by treatment, and at this time its use should be reserved for seriously affected adult patients who can participate in a controlled clinical trial. Every hematologist, internist, or pediatrician sees a few patients who are so severely afflicted by sickle cell anemia that their lives seem totally blighted. It is very tempting to consider treating them with hydroxyurea, because the drug is available in any pharmacy, but it is equally important to consider whether the treatment would accomplish any more than treating the physician's own sense of futility, or making the patient feel that "something was being done." If hydroxyurea were as safe as folic acid, treatment for these purposes would be reasonable. It is not, but its use may still be appropriate (although illegal unless used under an Investigational New Drug Agreement, because its use for this purpose is not approved by the FDA). Whether or not it is legal, prescription of hydroxyurea for patients with sickle cell anemia would be ethical or proper only if the potential risks, the variability of the Hb F response, and the lack of proof of clinical efficacy were clearly explained to potential recipients.",

"The relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and cardiac complications has never been systematically studied in thalassaemia major (TM). We evaluated a large retrospective historical cohort of TM to determine whether DM is associated with a higher risk of heart complications. We compared 86 TM patients affected by DM with 709 TM patients without DM consecutively included in the Myocardial Iron Overload in Thalassaemia database where clinical/instrumental data are recorded from birth to the first cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) exam. All of the cardiac events considered were developed after the DM diagnosis. In DM patients versus non-DM patients we found a significantly higher frequency of cardiac complications (46.5% vs. 16.9%, P < 0.0001), heart failure (HF) (30.2% vs. 11.7%, P < 0.0001), hyperkinetic arrhythmias (18.6% vs. 5.5%, P < 0.0001) and myocardial fibrosis assessed by late gadolinium enhancement (29.9% vs. 18.4%, P = 0.008). TM patients with DM had a significantly higher risk of cardiac complications [odds ratio (OR) 2.84, P < 0.0001], HF (OR 2.32, P = 0.003), hyperkinetic arrhythmias (OR 2.21, P = 0.023) and myocardial fibrosis (OR 1.91, P = 0.021), also adjusting for the absence of myocardial iron overload assessed by T2* CMR and for the covariates (age and/or endocrine co-morbidity). In conclusion, DM significantly increases the risk for cardiac complications, HF, hyperkinetic arrhythmias and myocardial fibrosis in TM patients.",

"Prevalence and prognostic value of conduction disturbances in patients with the Brugada syndrome (BrS) remains poorly known. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) from 325 patients with BrS (47 Â± 13 years, 258 men) with spontaneous (n = 143) or drug-induced (n = 182) type 1 ECG were retrospectively reviewed. Two hundred twenty-six patients (70%) were asymptomatic, 73 patients (22%) presented with unexplained syncope, and 26 patients (8%) presented with sudden death or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator appropriated therapies at diagnosis or during a mean follow-up of 48 Â± 34 months. P-wave duration of â¥120 ms was present in 129 patients (40%), first degree atrioventricular block (AVB) in 113 (35%), right bundle branch block (BBB) in 90 (28%), and fascicular block in 52 (16%). Increased P-wave duration, first degree AVB, and right BBB were more often present in patients after drug challenge than in patients with spontaneous type 1 ST elevation. Left BBB was present in 3 patients. SCN5A mutation carriers had longer P-wave duration and longer PR and HV intervals. In multivariate analysis, first degree AVB was independently associated with sudden death or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator appropriated therapies (odds ratio 2.41, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 5.73, p = 0.046) together with the presence of syncope and spontaneous type 1 ST elevation. In conclusion, conduction disturbances are frequent and sometimes diffuse in patients with BrS. First degree AVB is independently linked to outcome and may be proposed to be used for individual risk stratification.",

"Treatment of tuberculous meningitis or tuberculoma has become complicated because of adverse drug interactions found amongst antitubercular and anticonvulsant drugs. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of simultaneously administered isoniazid (300 mg/day) and phenytoin (300 mg/day) on 60 patients with tuberculous meningitis or tuberculoma having seizures. Plasma samples were analyzed for isoniazid, acetylated-isoniazid (AcINH) and phenytoin levels by high performance liquid chromatography at 3h of drugs administration and patients were classified as rapid or slow acetylator on the basis of metabolic ratio of isoniazid (Rm) and percentage of acetylated-isoniazid (%AcINH). Out of 60 patients studied, 23 were slow acetylators and 37 were rapid acetylators. Slow acetylators revealed higher plasma isoniazid levels and lower plasma AcINH levels, metabolic ratio and %AcINH as compared to rapid acetylators. Plasma phenytoin levels were found to be significantly higher (above therapeutic range) in slow acetylators as compared to rapid acetylators. Plasma phenytoin concentration was moderately strong, negatively correlated with metabolic ratio (r=-0.439, P<0.001) and %AcINH (r=-0.729, P<0.001). Eight comatose patients (34.8%) also showed significantly higher plasma phenytoin levels. Our results suggest that assessment of acetylator status and plasma phenytoin level is critical for dose optimization of isoniazid and phenytoin and to predict the patients at risk of intoxication.",

"Supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs) are a major cause of morbidity in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD). Few data exist on safety and efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs in this population. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs in adults with CHD and first-onset SVT on maintaining sinus rhythm after conversion. This was a multicenter retrospective study including adults with CHD and first-onset SVT from January 2008 to January 2011. First-onset SVT occurred in 92 of 7,171 patients without previous SVT (mean age 51 Â± 16 years, 57% women). SVTs included atrial fibrillation and flutter in >80% of the patients. Most of these patients had septal defects (50%) and left-sided lesions (21%). The acute management of SVTs resulted in sinus rhythm in 83 patients, and 89% of these patients were instituted on oral antiarrhythmics to prevent SVT recurrence. After a mean follow-up of 2.5 Â± 1.4 years, only 45% of the patients were free from SVT. Class III antiarrhythmics (85% sotalol and 15% amiodarone) were associated with a significantly lesser risk of SVT recurrence compared with all other antiarrhythmic drugs (hazard ratio 0.5, 95% confidence interval 0.27 to 0.96, p = 0.036). However, adverse effects of medication occurred in 22% of the patients, mainly in patients taking amiodarone. In conclusion, in adults with CHD and first-onset SVTs, class III antiarrhythmics are more efficacious in maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion than other antiarrhythmics. Sotalol may be considered as the first-choice therapy as this is associated with fewer adverse effects than amiodarone.",
"The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of steroid administration under standardised conditions in a range of patients both normal and with adrenal pathologies and to review the impact on plasma catecholamines and metanephrines. Corticosteroid administration has been linked to the development of hypertensive crises in patients with phaeochromocytoma, however a mechanism for this is not fully understood. We aimed to add useful information about the effect of steroids on levels of these hormones under usual circumstances. A prospective, observational cohort study of 50 patients undergoing the low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (LDDST) was undertaken. Additional blood samples were taken at the start and end of the standard LDDST. Biochemical analysis was carried out for plasma catecholamines and plasma free metanephrines. Demographic and hormonal data were acquired from review of the notes or measured at baseline. No significant changes in plasma catecholamines or metanephrines were seen at the end of the LDDST compared to baseline. This was also true of subgroup analysis, divided by age, gender, or type of underlying pathology. Our results suggest that hypertensive reaction responses, rare as they are, are unlikely to be related to normal adrenal physiology. Thus LDDST is likely to be safe under most circumstances, however caution should be exercised in patients with adrenal masses with imaging characteristics compatible with phaeochromocytoma. It may be prudent to defer glucocorticoid administration until functioning phaeochromocytoma has been excluded biochemically.",
"Antiretroviral therapy was initiated in 98.9% of HIV-infected children during the study. Among HIV-infected children, protocol-defined tuberculosis or death occurred in 52 children (19.0%) in the isoniazid group and 53 (19.3%) in the placebo group (P=0.93). Among HIV-uninfected children, there was no significant difference in the combined incidence of tuberculosis infection, tuberculosis disease, or death between the isoniazid group (39 children, 10%) and the placebo group (45 children, 11%; P=0.44). The rate of tuberculosis was 121 cases per 1000 child-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 95 to 153) among HIV-infected children as compared with 41 per 1000 child-years (95% CI, 31 to 52) among HIV-uninfected children.

"The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of interpleural bupivacaine on analgesia and ventilatory capacity after cholecystectomy. Forty-two patients undergoing elective cholecystectomy were randomly assigned to two groups: one to receive interpleural administration of bupivacaine-adrenaline mixture (Group 1 = 22 patients) and the other standard administration of intramuscular meperidine (Group 2 = 20 patients) for postoperative pain relief. The intensity of pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperatively as well as at 2, 8, 24 and 48 hr postoperatively. At the same time, FVC and FEV1.0 measurements were obtained for all patients. The group given interpleural bupivacaine had better pain relief with mean VAS of 0.6 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SD) 1.1 +/- 1.4, 0.6 +/- 0.9 and 0.8 +/- 1.2 compared with 5.2 +/- 2.2, 5.8 +/- 2.7, 5.5 +/- 2.2 and 4.5 +/- 1.8 for patients receiving meperidine (P less than 0.001). The patients in Group 1 also had larger FVC and FEV than those in Group 2: FVC 22 +/- 14.5 per cent vs 32 +/- 15.2 per cent (P less than 0.005), FEV1.0 25 +/- 15.5 vs 38 +/- 14.8 per cent (P less than 0.001) (mean +/- SD). We conclude that the interpleural analgesia can achieve better pain relief with greater ventilatory capacity than a standard analgesic regimen in the first two days after cholecystectomy.",

"Standard methods to monitor tuberculosis (TB) treatment response rely on sputum microscopy and culture conversion. Alternatives to these methods are needed for those patients whose sputum tests are smear or culture negative. Here, we examine anti-phospholipid IgM antibody level changes as a biomarker for treatment response in smear positive TB patients. Serum samples were obtained from 40 pulmonary TB patients at the start and end of the intensive phase treatment (IPT) from the CDC-TB Trials Consortium randomized clinical trial in Kampala, Uganda. Samples were screened by ELISA for IgM levels against five phospholipids found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and host cells. Lipid antigens included cardiolipin (CL), phosphatidyl inositol (PI), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE), phosphatidyl choline (PTC), and sphingolipid (SL). Levels of IgM against all phospholipids significantly decreased (pÂ =Â 0.034, 0.001, 0.008 0.008, 0.040, respectively) following anti-TB drug treatment in patients without lung cavitary disease at baseline. The mean sensitivity of this test in these patients was 83% when the IgM response to a single lipid antigen was used; it was >90% when responses to 2 or more lipids were assessed. In contrast, cavitary TB patients showed an overall IgM increase, with a significant rise against PE (pÂ =Â 0.025). There was no significant difference in the change in antibody levels between patients who remained culture-positive and those who culture-converted after 40 doses of drug therapy. The measurement of IgM anti-phospholipid antibodies may be a useful biomarker to monitor treatment response in non-cavitary TB patients.",

"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is frequently associated with desmosomal mutations. However, nondesmosomal mutations may be involved. The aim of this study was to assess the contribution of a phospholamban (PLN) gene mutation to ARVD/C diagnosis according to the revised 2010 task force criteria (TFC). In 142 Dutch patients (106 men, mean age 51 Â± 13 years) with proven ARVD/C (fulfillment of 2010 TFC for diagnosis), 5 known desmosomal genes (PKP2, DSP, DSC2, DSG2, and JUP) and the nondesmosomal PLN gene were screened. After genetic analysis, phenotypic characteristics of desmosomal versus PLN mutation carriers were compared. In 59 of 142 patients with ARVD/C (42%), no desmosomal mutation was found. In 19 of 142 patients (13%), the PLN founder mutation c.40_42delAGA (p.Arg14del) was identified. PLN mutation carriers more often had low-voltage electrocardiograms (pÂ = 0.004), inverted T waves in leads V4 to V6 (p <0.001), and additional structural (pÂ = 0.007) or functional (pÂ = 0.017) left ventricular impairment, whereas desmosomal mutation carriers had more solitary right ventricular abnormalities. The revised TFC included 21 of 142 patients with proven ARVD/C who did not meet the 1994 TFC, including 7 PLN mutation carriers. In conclusion, there is a substantial contribution of PLN mutation to ARVD/C diagnosis by the 2010 TFC. In 32% of patients (19 of 59) with genetically unexplained proven ARVD/C, this nondesmosomal mutation was found. PLN mutation carriers have ARVD/C characteristics, including important right ventricular involvement, and additionally more often low-voltage electrocardiograms, inverted T waves in the left precordial leads, and left ventricular involvement.",

Eighteen subjects/group received ascending doses (5, 20, 80, or 160 Î¼g) of the vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months; 8 subjects received placebo. Most of the injection site and systemic reactions were mild to moderate in intensity. After 2 or 3 doses of the vaccine at any concentration, antibody levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were significantly higher than those for the placebo group. Sera from subjects who received 3 doses of the vaccine at any concentration inhibited the growth of erythrocyte-stage P. falciparum at low levels compared to sera from placebo recipients or preimmune sera. In conclusion, the EBA-175 vaccine with adjuvant was safe and immunogenic in malaria-naÃ¯ve subjects.",
"The objective and background is to confirm in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study the high triptan response rates we had previously reported in an open study in migraine patients with unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 80 migraineurs with unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms were assigned to receive rizatriptan 10Â mg wafer or placebo (ratio 1:1) and treated for a single moderate or severe migraine attack. The primary endpoints were pain freedom at 2Â h and total migraine freedom at 2Â h. Secondary endpoints included pain relief, no associated symptoms and sustained pain freedom or relief. Significantly more patients reported pain freedom at 2Â h after taking rizatriptan (54Â %) than after placebo (8Â %) (therapeutic gain 46Â % [28Â %; 64Â %]; PÂ <Â 0.001). Similarly, significantly more patients reported total migraine freedom at 2Â h after rizatriptan (51Â %) than after placebo (8Â %) (therapeutic gain 43Â % [26Â %; 61Â %]; PÂ <Â 0.001). Rizatriptan was also more effective than placebo on most secondary endpoints. We confirm in a placebo-controlled study our previous data suggesting that the presence of unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms in migraineurs predicts a positive response to triptans, probably owing to intense trigeminal peripheral afferent activation which strongly recruits peripheral neurovascular 5-HT1B/1D receptors. Acute and preventive pharmacological trials in migraine should focus also on this subset of migraine patients.",

"Although artesunate is clearly superior, parenteral quinine is still used widely for the treatment of severe malaria. A loading-dose regimen has been recommended for 30 years but is still often not used. A population pharmacokinetic study was conducted with 75 Tanzanian children aged 4 months to 8 years with severe malaria who received quinine intramuscularly; 69 patients received a loading dose of 20 mg quinine dihydrochloride (salt)/kg of body weight. Twenty-one patients had plasma quinine concentrations detectable at baseline. A zero-order absorption model with one-compartment disposition pharmacokinetics described the data adequately. Body weight was the only significant covariate and was implemented as an allometric function on clearance and volume parameters. Population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates (and percent relative standard errors [%RSE]) of elimination clearance, central volume of distribution, and duration of zero-order absorption were 0.977 liters/h (6.50%), 16.7 liters (6.39%), and 1.42 h (21.5%), respectively, for a typical patient weighing 11 kg. Quinine exposure was reduced at lower body weights after standard weight-based dosing; there was 18% less exposure over 24 h in patients weighing 5 kg than in those weighing 25 kg. Maximum plasma concentrations after the loading dose were unaffected by body weight. There was no evidence of dose-related drug toxicity with the loading dosing regimen. Intramuscular quinine is rapidly and reliably absorbed in children with severe falciparum malaria. Based on these pharmacokinetic data, a loading dose of 20 mg salt/kg is recommended, provided that no loading dose was administered within 24 h and no routine dose was administered within 12 h of admission. (This study has been registered with Current Controlled Trials under registration number ISRCTN 50258054.).",

"To evaluate the sustainability of market-based community distribution of micronutrient powders (Sprinkles(Â®), Hexagon Nutrition, Mumbai, India.) among pre-school children in Kenya, we conducted in August 2010 a follow-up survey, 18 months after study-related marketing and household monitoring ended. We surveyed 849 children aged 6-35 months randomly selected from 60 study villages. Nutritional biomarkers were measured by fingerstick; demographic characteristics, Sprinkles purchases and use were assessed through household questionnaires. We compared Sprinkles use, marketing efforts and biomarker levels with the data from surveys conducted in March 2007, March 2008 and March 2009. We used logistic regression to evaluate associations between marketing activities and Sprinkles use in the 2010 survey. At the 2010 follow-up, 21.9% of children used Sprinkles in the previous 7 days, compared with 64.9% in 2008 (P < 0.001). Average intake was 3.2 sachets week(-1) in 2008, 1.6 sachets week(-1) in 2009 and 1.1 sachets week(-1) in 2010 (P < 0.001). Factors associated with recent Sprinkles use in 2010 included young age [6-23 months vs. 24-35 months, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.5, P = 0.02], lowest 2 quintiles of socio-economic status (aOR = 1.7, P = 0.004), household attendance at trainings or launches (aOR = 2.8, P < 0.001) and ever receiving promotional items including free Sprinkles, calendars, cups and t-shirts (aOR = 1.7, P = 0.04). In 2010, there was increased prevalence of anaemia and malaria (P < 0.001), but not iron deficiency (P = 0.44), compared with that in 2008. Sprinkles use in 2010 was associated with decreased iron deficiency (P = 0.03). Sprinkles coverage reduced after stopping household monitoring and reducing marketing activities. Continued promotion and monitoring of Sprinkles usage may be important components to sustain the programme.",

"The Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH) was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to test whether hydroxyurea could reduce the rate of painful crises in adults who had at least 3 painful crises per year. Because hydroxyurea is known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic in animals, a major inclusion criterion in MSH was the use of contraceptives both by females and males in order to avoid exposure of the fetus to hydroxyurea. Despite this precautionary measure, some women became pregnant while taking hydroxyurea or their male partners were on hydroxyurea. We followed surviving patients who were enrolled in the original MSH trial for up to 17 years postrandomization. Our findings suggest that exposure of the fetus to hydroxyurea does not cause teratogenic changes in those pregnancies that terminate in live birth whether full-term or premature. This seems to be true whether the parent taking hydroxyurea was the mother or the father. The same argument seems to apply for exposure to opioids. However, it will take a much longer follow-up of many more hydroxyurea-exposed sickle cell disease subjects to establish the results conclusively.",

"The major pathology in sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is sickling of red cells due to the precipitation of reduced haemoglobin. We report our experience with extract of Cajanus cajan as a possible antisickling agent by determining changes, if any, in clinical and laboratory features of the disease in patients given the extract in a single-blind placebo-controlled study. One hundred patients with steady-state SCA were randomized into treatment and placebo arms. The extract/placebo were administered twice daily to the subjects. Weight, hepatosplenomegaly, blood levels of biliurubin, urea, creatinine, and packed cell volume (PCV) were monitored over a 6-month period. Recall episodes of pain 6 months before enrolment were compared with episodes of pains recorded during the treatment period. Twenty-six cases (55.3 per cent) had hepatomegaly on enrolment. This significantly reduced to 33.3 per cent at 6 months (p = 0.03); but increased in the placebo arm (p > 0.05). The total number of recall painful episodes in cases was 207 (mean 4.4 +/- 10.3 (SD), range 0-60) and fell to 191 (mean 4.2 +/- 4.4 (SD), range 0-16); p = 0.03. Episodes of pain increased from 109 in controls (mean 2.6 +/- 5.0 (SD), range 0-26) to 164 (mean 3.9 +/- 4.3 (SD), range 0-22); p = 0.01. Mean PCV in the cases showed no appreciable changes (p = 0.1) but there was a significant increase in the controls (p = 0.02). In conclusion, the extract may cause a reduction of painful crises and may ameliorate the adverse effects of sickle cell anaemia on the liver. The mechanism of action remains to be determined.",

"The in-hospital management of patients on warfarin undergoing coronary stent implantation (PCI-S) is variable, and the in-hospital outcome incompletely defined. To determine the adherence to the current recommendations, and the incidence of adverse events, we carried out the prospective, multicenter, observational WARfarin and coronary STENTing (WAR-STENT) registry (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00722319). All consecutive patients on warfarin undergoing PCI-S at 37 Italian centers were enrolled and followed for 12 months. Outcome measures were: major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, need for urgent revascularization, stroke, and venous thromboembolism, and major and minor bleeding. In this paper, we report the in-hospital findings. Out of the 411 patients enrolled, 92% were at non-low (ie, moderate or high) thromboembolic risk. The radial approach and bare-metal stents were used in 61% and 60% of cases, respectively. Drug-eluting stents were essentially reserved to patients with diabetes, which in turn, significantly predicted the implantation of drug-eluting stents (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29-3.17; P=.002). The in-hospital MACE and major bleeding rates were 2.7% and 2.1%, respectively. At discharge, triple therapy (TT) of warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel was prescribed to 76% of patients. Prescription of TT was significantly more frequent in the non-low thromboembolic risk group. Non-low thromboembolic risk, in turn, was a significant predictor of TT prescription (OR, 11.2; 95% CI, 4.83-26.3; P<.0001). In conclusion, real-world warfarin patients undergoing PCI-S are largely managed according to the current recommendations. As a consequence, the risk of in-hospital MACE and major bleedings appears limited and acceptable.",

"In order to investigate the plausible association of migraine recurrence with anxiety and depressive symptoms, a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial was conducted using sumatriptan as a vehicle drug. Migraineurs were randomly assigned to receive either 50 mg sumatriptan or placebo for three consecutive migraine attacks, and then cross over to the other treatment for three more migraine attacks. The primary measurements were the observed rate of migraine recurrence in relation to (i) patient's mood condition, measured by the Hamilton rating scales for depression and anxiety and (ii) patient's general health and functioning measured by the Symptom Checklist (SCL)-90-R. Migraine recurrence was defined as any migrainous headache that occurred within 24 h post treatment, only when pain free at 2 h was achieved. The analysis of efficacy was performed on 376 migraine attacks treated with sumatriptan and 373 attacks treated with placebo. Recurrence ratio was 14.1% and 5.1%, respectively (P = 0.045). The number needed to treat for pain free at 2 h post dose was 5.4. Recurrence was not affected by Hamilton scores for depression or anxiety, SCL-90-R scores or treatment. Apparently, depressive or anxiety symptoms do not influence headache recurrence in acute pharmaceutical migraine treatment, but further investigation is required.",

"Thrombocytopenia is often regarded as a risk factor for bleeding complications in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The risk of mild to moderate baseline and acquired thrombocytopenia on bleeding and thrombotic or thromboembolic complications in patients with atrial fibrillation on oral anticoagulation therapy undergoing PCI, however, remains largely unknown. Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation undergoing Coronary Artery Stenting is a multicenter European prospective registry enrolling patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI. We assessed the rate of bleeding complications as defined by Bleeding Academic Research Consortium and a composite of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) including all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack or stroke, stent thrombosis, systemic arterial embolism, or revascularization; and a composite of any harmful event (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium and MACCE) at 12-month follow-up in 861 consecutive patients undergoing PCI. Patients were divided into those with mild to moderate baseline thrombocytopenia (platelet count <150 Ã 10â¹/L; n = 99) and control group (platelet count >150 Ã 10â¹/L; n = 762). At hospital discharge, thrombocytopenia had no effect on prescribed antithrombotic treatment, and triple therapy (vitamin K antagonist + aspirin + clopidogrel) was the most common combination in both patient groups (69% vs 73%, p = 0.40). No differences in all-cause mortality (12% vs 11%, p = 0.79), MACCE (23% vs 22%, p = 0.87), or bleeding complications (23% vs 19%, p = 0.26) were detected. Acquired in-hospital thrombocytopenia occurred in 9.7% of patients, and it was associated with similar risk of adverse outcomes compared with control group. In conclusion, mild to moderate baseline thrombocytopenia does not seem to have a clinically significant effect on bleeding or thrombotic or thromboembolic complications after PCI in these frail patients receiving multiple antithrombotic drugs.",

"In addition to vaso-occlusion by sickled erythrocytes, the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease (SCD) is compounded by the diminished bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO), associated with vasoconstriction, endothelial activation and cell adhesion. We tested the ability of sodium nitrite, which can be converted to NO by deoxyhaemoglobin at acid pH and low oxygen tension, to improve blood flow in patients with SCD. In a phase I/II clinical trial, sodium nitroprusside, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, and sodium nitrite were infused sequentially into the brachial artery in 14 patients at steady state. In a dose-dependent manner, sodium nitrite infusion rates of 0.4, 4 and 40 micromol/min into the brachial artery augmented mean venous plasma nitrite concentrations (P < 0.0001) and stimulated forearm blood flow up to 77 +/- 11% above baseline (P < 0.0001), measured by venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography. This nitrite response was blunted significantly compared to controls without SCD, as previously seen with other NO donors. Sodium nitrite infusions were well tolerated without hypotension, clinically significant methaemoglobinaemia or other untoward events. The unique pharmacological properties of nitrite as a hypoxia-potentiated vasodilator and cytoprotective agent in the setting of ischaemia-reperfusion injury make this anion a plausible NO donor for future clinical trials in SCD.",
"Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with worse outcomes after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and impact of new-onset AF after primary PCI in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions from the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial. HORIZONS-AMI was a large-scale, multicenter, international, randomized trial comparing different antithrombotic regimens and stents during primary PCI in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions. Three-year ischemic and bleeding end points were compared between patients with and without new-onset AF after PCI. Of the 3,602 patients included in the HORIZONS-AMI study, 3,281 (91.1%) with sinus rhythm at initial presentation had primary PCI as their primary management strategy. Of these, new-onset AF developed in 147 (4.5%). Compared with patients without AF after PCI, patients with new-onset AF had higher 3-year rates of net adverse clinical events (46.5% vs 25.7%, pÂ <0.0001), mortality (11.9% vs 6.3%, pÂ = 0.01), reinfarction (16.4% vs 7.0%, p <0.0001), stroke (5.8% vs 1.5%, p <0.0001), and major bleeding (20.9% vs 8.2%, p <0.0001). By multivariate analysis, new-onset AF after PCI was a powerful independent predictor of netÂ adverse clinical events (hazard ratio 1.74, 95% confidence interval 1.30 to 2.34, pÂ =Â 0.0002) and major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 2.36) at 3 years. In conclusion, new-onset AF after PCI for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was associated with markedly higher rates of adverse events and mortality.",

"Primary aldosteronism (PA), a common cause of high blood pressure (BP), induces left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and an excess rate of cardiovascular events. Whether its treatment provides long-term cure of hypertension and regression of cardiovascular damage remains uncertain. To the aim of assessing the effect of treatment of PA on BP and LV changes, we prospectively recruited 323 patients in a long-term follow-up study entailing serial echocardiography evaluations. Of them, 180 had PA and were assigned to either adrenalectomy (n=110) or medical therapy (n=70) on the basis of the adrenal vein sampling. The remaining 143 were consecutive optimally treated primary hypertensive patients. At baseline, the PA patients had more inappropriate LV mass than PH patients (27.1% versus 16.2%; P=0.020), despite similar BP values. At a median follow-up of 36 months (range, 6-225), BP was lowered (P<0.0001 versus baseline) to similar values in adrenalectomized (135Â±15/83Â±9 mm Hg), medically treated PA (133Â±11/83Â±7 mm Hg), and PH (139Â±15/86Â±9 mm Hg) patients. To this end, the adrenalectomized patients required significantly less drugs than the other groups. In PA patients, the LV mass index and the rate of LV hypertrophy fell through LV inward remodeling to the level of optimally treated PH patients, indicating that the LV work markedly decreased. Findings were similar when long-term (â¥5 and â¥10 years) data were examined. Thus, an early diagnosis and a specific treatment of PA warrant normalization of BP and reversal of detrimental LV changes at long term.",

"Insulin aspart (IAsp) has been used in patients for more than a decade. A plethora of data is available, from clinical trials, to document its efficacy and safety and suggest that IAsp is a favorable choice to be used in a basal-bolus regimen. The A1chieve@ was a non-interventional study that explored the safety and effectiveness of initiating or switching to insulin analogues in routine clinical practice in more than 60,000 patients from 28 different countries. In this manuscript, we discuss the findings from the subgroup of the Indian cohort who were treated with insulin aspart (IAsp), in addition to a basal insulin analogue (insulin detemir, IDet). In a cohort of 343, who were on IAsp + IDet, 175 (51%) were insulin naive and 168 (49%) had been on insulin therapy earlier. Glycaemic parameters were high at baseline. Mean HbA1c was 9.3% in them and was comparable in both insulin naive and insulin experienced groups. After 24 weeks of therapy with IAsp + basal insulin, there were reductions in HbA1c in both the insulin naive group, (-1.6) and insulin experienced group (-1.5). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels were also reduced significantly from baseline (-77 and - 110 mg/dL, respectively, p < 0.001). Overall, hypoglycaemia decreased from 0.97 (baseline) to 0.18 events/patient years (24 weeks). There was also an increase in quality of life score as evaluated by EQ-5D questionnaire. Addition of IAsp with a basal insulin in patients with poor glycaemic control leads to an improvement in glycaemic profile with no major hypoglycaemia or clinically significant weight gain along with an improvement in the quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

"The REgistry on Cardiac rhythm disORDers assessing the control of Atrial Fibrillation (RecordAF) is the first worldwide, 1-year observational, longitudinal study of the management of paroxysmal/persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in recently diagnosed patients. The study was conducted at 532 sites in 21 countries across Europe, America, and Asia; recruitment was completed in April 2008. The primary objectives were to prospectively assess the therapeutic success and clinical outcomes in rhythm- and rate-control strategies. The study design and patient baseline data are reported. A total of 5,814 patients with AF were registered, and 5,604 were eligible for evaluation. Rhythm- and rate-control strategies were applied to 55% and 45% of patients, respectively, at study inclusion. Rhythm-control patients mainly received class III agents (45%) or beta blockers (51%), except for sotalol, and rate-control patients mainly received beta blockers (72%), except for sotalol, or cardiac glycosides (34%). Patients receiving a rhythm-control strategy were younger, had a lower resting heart rate, were more frequently symptomatic, and were more likely to have recently diagnosed AF or paroxysmal AF compared to patients receiving a rate-control strategy. A rate-control strategy was more common in patients with a history of heart failure or valvular heart disease and persistent AF. Rate-control patients more often had previous electrocardiographic evidence of AF and were not in sinus rhythm at inclusion (p <0.01 for both end points). Patients were followed at 6 and 12 months, and changes in therapeutic strategy and clinical outcomes were recorded. In conclusion, the RecordAF study results will provide a global perspective on current AF treatment strategies.",

"Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy is increasingly used in elderly for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and of stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), usually estimated from different equations, decreases progressively with age and it is a risk factor for bleeding. In the frame of the EPICA study, a multicentre prospective observational study including 4,093 patients â¥80 years naÃ¯ve to VKA treated for AF or after VTE, we performed this ancillary study to evaluate the prevalence of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) by estimated GFR (eGFR). Incidence of bleedings was recorded and bleeding risk was evaluated in relation to eGFR calculated by Cockroft-Gault (C-G); Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formulas. In addition, the agreement among the three eGFR formulas was evaluated. We recorded 179 major bleedings (rate 1.87 x100 patient-years [py]), 26 fatal (rate 0.27 x100 py). Moderate CKD was detected in 69.3%, 59.3% and 47.0% and severe CKD in 5.8%, 7.4% and 10.0% of cases by C-G, MDRD and CKD-EPI, respectively. Bleeding risk was higher in patients with severe CKD irrespective of the applied equation. This study confirms that CKD represents an independent risk factor for bleeding and that a wide proportion of elderly on VKA had severe or moderate CKD, suggesting the need for frequent monitoring. Although the different available equations yield different eGFR, all appear to similarly predict the risk of major bleeding.",

"Although there is no agreement on the optimal treatment of patients presenting with a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, the majority of physicians prefer chest tube drainage for air evacuation. Manual aspiration of air has been proposed by some, but lack of sound comparative data and safety data has limited its use. In this first randomized, prospective, multicenter pilot study, 60 patients with a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax were randomly allocated to manual aspiration (n = 27) or chest tube drainage (n = 33). Immediate success was obtained in 16 out of 27 (59.3%) in the manual aspiration group, and in 21 out of 33 (63.6%) in the chest tube drainage group (p = 0.9). One-week success rates were 25 out of 27 (93%) in the intention-to-treat manual aspiration group and 28 out of 33 (85%) in the chest tube drainage group (p = 0.4). Fourteen of 27 manual aspiration patients (52%) were hospitalized, versus 100% of the chest tube drainage patients (p < 0.0001). Recurrence rates with at least 1-year follow-up were 7 out of 26 (26%) in the manual aspiration group, and 9 out of 33 (27.3%) in the chest tube drainage group (p = 0.9). There were no complications associated with manual aspiration. Although statistical power is insufficient to formally confirm therapeutic equality, this pilot study suggests that in first episodes of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, manual aspiration seems equally effective as chest tube drainage and is safe, well tolerated, and feasible as an outpatient procedure in the majority of patients.",
"The efficacy and safety of a 2-year treatment with deferasirox was evaluated in 31 patients with sickle cell anemia and transfusional iron overload. At 24 months, there were significant decreases from baseline in mean serum ferritin (from 2,344.6 to 1,986.3 Âµg/l; p = 0.040) and in mean liver iron concentration (from 13.0 Â± 5.4 to 9.3 Â± 5.7 mg Fe/g dry weight; p < 0.001). Myocardial T2* values were normal (>20 ms) in all patients at baseline and did not change significantly over the course of the study. However, there was a significant improvement from baseline in left ventricular ejection fraction at 24 months (62.2-64.6%; p = 0.02). Deferasirox was generally well tolerated with no progressive increases in serum creatinine or renal failure observed. These data confirm that deferasirox is effective in reducing body iron burden in patients with sickle cell anemia and transfusional iron overload.",
"In most countries with large drug resistant tuberculosis epidemics, only those cases that are at highest risk of having MDRTB receive a drug sensitivity test (DST) at the time of diagnosis. Because of this prioritized testing, identification of MDRTB transmission hotspots in communities where TB cases do not receive DST is challenging, as any observed aggregation of MDRTB may reflect systematic differences in how testing is distributed in communities. We introduce a new disease mapping method, which estimates this missing information through probability-weighted locations, to identify geographic areas of increased risk of MDRTB transmission. We apply this method to routinely collected data from two districts in Lima, Peru over three consecutive years. This method identifies an area in the eastern part of Lima where previously untreated cases have increased risk of MDRTB. This may indicate an area of increased transmission of drug resistant disease, a finding that may otherwise have been missed by routine analysis of programmatic data. The risk of MDR among retreatment cases is also highest in these probable transmission hotspots, though a high level of MDR among retreatment cases is present throughout the study area. Identifying potential multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) transmission hotspots may allow for targeted investigation and deployment of resources.",

"Intensive statin therapy is a central component of secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly among high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the frequency and predictors of intensive statin therapy use after AMI among patients with DM have not been described. We examined patterns of intensive statin therapy use (defined as a statin with expected low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering of >50%) at discharge among patients with AMI with known DM enrolled in a 24-site US registry. Predictors of intensive statin therapy use were evaluated using multivariable hierarchical Poisson regression models. Among 1,300 patients with DM after AMI, 22% were prescribed intensive statin therapy at hospital discharge. In multivariable models, ST-elevation AMI (risk ratio [RR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29 to 1.70), insurance for medications (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.63), and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (RR 1.05 per 1Â mg/dl, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.07) were independent predictors of intensive statin therapy, whereas higher Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events scores were associated with lower rates of intensive statin therapy (RR 0.94 per 10 points, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98). In conclusion, only 1 in 5 patients with DM was prescribed intensive statin therapy at discharge after an AMI. Predictors of intensive statin therapy use suggest important opportunities to improve quality of care in this patient population.",

"Using a novel positron emission tomography (PET) method with oral administration of 14(R,S)-[Â¹â¸F]-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid (Â¹â¸FTHA), we recently demonstrated that subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) display an impairment in cardiac function associated with increased myocardial uptake of dietary fatty acids. Here, we determined whether modest weight loss induced by lifestyle changes might improve these cardiac metabolic and functional abnormalities. Nine participants with IGT, enrolled in a one-year lifestyle intervention trial, were invited to undergo determination of organ-specific postprandial dietary fatty acids partition using the oral Â¹â¸FTHA method, and cardiac function and oxidative metabolic index using PET [Â¹Â¹C]acetate kinetics with ECG-gated PET ventriculography before and after the intervention. The intervention resulted in significant weight loss and reduction of waist circumference, with reduced postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, and triglycerides excursion. We observed a significant increase in stroke volume, cardiac output, and left ventricular ejection fraction associated with reduced myocardial oxidative metabolic index and fractional dietary fatty acid uptake. Modest weight loss corrects the exaggerated myocardial channeling of dietary fatty acids and improves myocardial energy substrate metabolism and function in IGT subjects.",

"Although, several reports have detailed that hydroxyurea can ameliorate the clinical course of adult and pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia (Hb S or beta(S)), few clinical studies have been carried out in patients with beta(S)/beta-thalassemia. In a two-year clinical study, we evaluated the efficacy of hydroxyurea in a group of 22 adult Sicilian patients with beta(S)/beta-thalassemia with severe phenotypes. Among the 20 patients evaluated during 2 years of treatment, we observed a very good clinical response with a 93% reduction of the annual number of crises (median 7 versus 0.5 crises per year; P < 0.001) and of days in hospital (mean 22+/- 21.9 versus 1.2 +/- 2.3; P < 0.001), a significant increase in Hb F (7.5 +/- 5.3% versus 25.2 +/- 5.2%; P < 0.001) and in MCV (73.1 +/- 4.8 fL versus 96.4 +/- 7.2 fL; P < 0.001), and no significant modifications in Hb (9.6 +/- 1.3 g/dL versus 10.0 +/- 1.5 g/dL; P > 0.05) and in WBC (11.4 +/- 3.9 x 10(9)/L versus 10.2 +/- 3.9 x 10(9)/L; P > 0.05). Twelve patients had no crises from the first month of treatment; 16 patients showed a 2-3-fold increase over baseline in Hb F. During the study no severe complications and no important side effects of hydroxyurea were observed. Our data suggest that hydroxyurea efficacy in patients with beta(S)/beta-thalassemial may be greater than that described in patients with sickle cell disease. This pattern and durability of response will need to be confirmed in a larger, randomized, clinical trial.",

"At 4 years, the rates of target lesion failure (15.2% vs. 14.6%, p = 0.68), cardiac death (5.4% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.44), and target vessel myocardial infarction (5.3% vs. 5.4%, p = 1.00), clinically-indicated target lesion revascularization (TLR) (7.0% vs. 6.5%, p = 0.62), and definite/probable stent thrombosis (2.3% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.23) were similar with the R-ZES and EES. Independent predictors of TLR were age, insulin-treated diabetes, SYNTAX (Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) score, treatment of saphenous vein grafts, ostial lesions, and in-stent restenosis. Independent predictors of any revascularization were age, diabetes, previous percutaneous coronary intervention, absence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, smaller reference vessel diameter, SYNTAX score, and treatment of left anterior descending, right coronary artery, saphenous vein grafts, ostial lesions, or in-stent restenosis.",
"Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been suggested as the most appropriate choice for spontaneous pneumothorax. Thirty-two patients (30 males, two females, age range from 16 to 42) with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) are reported. All had mechanical pleurodesis with Marlex mesh. Blebs or bullae could be identified in 24 patients (75%). All bullae over 2 cm were either excised (11 patients) or ligated (five patients). The median operating time was 45 min. There was minimal postoperative discomfort and the median postoperative hospital stay was 4 days. There was one minor wound infection and one recurrence (mean follow up of 11 months). It is concluded that VATS is a quick, safe and effective approach for the treatment of PSP. Long-term results will better define its true merit in thoracic surgery.",

We believe that the discovery in this study will add information on candidate autoantigens that could potentially improve the diagnosis and help uncover the pathophysiology of T1D. The successful use of NAPPA for T1D AAb profiling will open the window for larger studies including more human antigen genes and other autoimmune diseases.",
"At 12 months, the mean LVESVI among surviving patients was 54.6Â±25.0 ml per square meter of body-surface area in the repair group and 60.7Â±31.5 ml per square meter in the replacement group (mean change from baseline, -6.6 and -6.8 ml per square meter, respectively). The rate of death was 14.3% in the repair group and 17.6% in the replacement group (hazard ratio with repair, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 1.47; P=0.45 by the log-rank test). There was no significant between-group difference in LVESVI after adjustment for death (z score, 1.33; P=0.18). The rate of moderate or severe recurrence of mitral regurgitation at 12 months was higher in the repair group than in the replacement group (32.6% vs. 2.3%, P<0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in the rate of a composite of major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events, in functional status, or in quality of life at 12 months.",

"Aggressively managing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after myocardial infarction (MI) is a cornerstone of secondary prevention. The changes in LDL-C after MI and the factors associated with LDL-C levels are unknown. Therefore, we directly measured fasting LDL-C levels in 797 MI patients from 24 US hospitals from 2005 to 2008. Mean LDL-C levels at discharge, 1 month, and 6 months were 95.1, 81.9, and 87.1 mg/dL, respectively. In a hierarchical, multivariable, repeated measures model, older age, male sex, and hypertension were associated with lower LDL-C levels, whereas self-reported avoidance of health care because of cost was associated with higher LDL-C. Both the presence and intensity of statin therapy at discharge were strongly associated with LDL-C levels, with adjusted mean 6-month changes of -3.4 mg/dL (95% confidence interval (CI): -12.1, 5.3) for no statins; 1.7 mg/dL (95% CI: -4.7, 8.1) for low statins; -10.2 mg/dL (95% CI: -14.5, -6.0) for moderate statins; and -13.9 mg/dL (95% CI: -19.7, -8.0) for intensive statins (P < 0.001). In conclusion, we found that greater reductions in LDL-C levels after MI were strongly associated with the presence and intensity of statin therapy, older age, male sex, hypertension, and better socioeconomic status. These findings support the use of intensive statin therapy in post-MI patients and provide estimates of the expected LDL-C changes after MI in a real-world population.",
"The aim of this Phase I/IIa double-blind controlled trial was to test the efficacy of the sporozoite-based malaria vaccine PfCS 282-383 (PfCS102) to protect against Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia. 16 volunteers were randomized to receive twice 30 Î¼g of PfCS102 formulated in Montanide ISA 720 or ISA 720 alone (control). Two weeks after 2nd immunization, volunteers were challenged using 5 infected mosquitoes. All vaccinees developed antibodies against PfCS102 versus none control. 8/8 vaccinees and 6/6 controls challenged developed malaria parasitaemia. The duration from infection to onset of patent parasitaemia was similar in both groups (214 h in vaccinees and 216 in controls). PfCS102 is safe and immunogenic but provides no protection against artificial challenge in its current formulation.",

"Short-term intensive insulin therapy (IIT) can improve pancreatic Î²-cell function when administered early in the course of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the degree of improvement in response to this therapy varies between patients. Thus, we sought to characterize the determinants of improvement in Î²-cell function in response to short-term IIT in early T2DM. Sixty-three patients with mean 3.0 Â± 2.1 yr duration of T2DM and Hb A1c of 6.8 Â± 0.8% underwent 4 wk of IIT consisting of basal insulin detemir and premeal insulin aspart, with oral glucose tolerance test administered at baseline and 1 day post-IIT. Î²-Cell function before and after IIT was assessed by Insulin Secretion Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2). Reversibility of Î²-cell dysfunction was defined as percentage change in ISSI-2 of â¥25%. Overall, the study population experienced an increase in ISSI-2 from baseline to post-IIT (P = 0.01), with one-third of participants achieving â¥25% improvement in ISSI-2. Compared with their peers, those with increases in ISSI-2 of â¥25% had greater decrements in fasting glucose (P < 0.0001), Hb A1c (P = 0.001), ALT (P = 0.04), AST (P = 0.02), and HOMA-IR (P < 0.0001). On logistical regression analysis, baseline Hb A1c (OR = 2.83, 95% CI 1.16-6.88, P = 0.02) and change in HOMA-IR (OR = 0.008, 95%CI 0.0004-0.16, P = 0.001) emerged as independent predictors of reversibility of Î²-cell dysfunction. Indeed, reversibility of Î²-cell dysfunction was achieved in only those participants in whom IIT yielded an improvement in HOMA-IR. In conclusion, decline in HOMA-IR may be a key determinant of improvement of Î²-cell function in response to short-term IIT, suggesting a fundamental contribution of insulin resistance to the reversible component of Î²-cell dysfunction in early T2DM.",
"Carbachol induces headache in healthy subjects, but the migraine eliciting effect of carbachol has not previously been studied. We hypothesized that the cholinomimetic agonist carbachol would induce headache and migraine-like attacks in migraineurs. Carbachol (3âÂµg/kg) or placebo was randomly infused into 18 patients with migraine without aura in a double-blind crossover study. Headache was scored on a verbal rating scale from 0 to 10. Velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V(MCA)) and diameter of the superficial temporal artery (STA) were recorded. Fifteen patients experienced headache after carbachol compared with eight after placebo (P = 0.039). There was no difference in incidence of migraine-like attacks after carbachol (n = 8) compared with placebo (n = 6) (P = 0.687). Carbachol caused a decrease in V(MCA) (P = 0.044), but no change in STA (P = 0.089) compared with placebo. The study demonstrated that carbachol provocation is not a good model for experimental migraine.",

"Chloroquine (CQ) is still the drug of choice for the treatment of vivax malaria in Ethiopia, whereas artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is for falciparum malaria. In this setting, clinical malaria cases are treated with AL. This necessitated the need to assess the effectiveness of AL for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax with CQ as a comparator. A total of 57 (80.3%) and 75 (85.2%) cases treated with CQ or AL, respectively, completed the study in an outpatient setting. At the end of the follow-up period of 28 days, a cumulative incidence of treatment failure of 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.9-18.9%) for CQ and 19% (95% CI = 11-31.6%) for AL was detected. CQ resistance was confirmed in three of five CQ treatment failures cases. The effectiveness of AL seems lower than CQ; however, the findings were not conclusive, because the AL evening doses were not supervised.",

"We evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness of mefloquine (MQ) plus artesunate (AS) to treat patients with uncomplicated malaria in the Peruvian Amazon Basin in April 2005-March 2006. Patients â¥ 1 year of age with fever (axillary temperature â¥ 37.5Â°C) or history of fever and Plasmodium falciparum monoinfection were included. Patients received antimalarial treatment with MQ (12.5 mg/kg/day for two days) and AS (4.0 mg/kg/day for three days) either by directly observed therapy or without directly observed therapy. After a 28-day follow-up, treatment efficacy and effectiveness were assessed on the basis of clinical and parasitologic outcomes. Ninety-six patients were enrolled in each study group; nine patients were lost to follow-up. All patients, except for one in the observed group, demonstrated adequate clinical and parasitologic response; none had detectable parasitemia on day 3. The efficacy of MQ + AS efficacy was 98.9% (95% confidence interval = 94.1-100.0%) and the effectiveness was 100.0% (95% confidence interval = 95.9-100.0%).

"Because alcohol septal ablation (ASA) for the treatment of symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) with left ventricular (LV) outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction results in a myocardial infarct of up to 10% of ventricular mass, LV systolic function could decline over time. We evaluated LV function during longitudinal follow-up in a cohort of patients who underwent ASA. We studied 145 consecutive patients with HC that underwent 167 ASA procedures from 2002 to 2011. Echocardiographic follow-up was available in 139 patients (96%). Echocardiographic indexes included LV ejection fraction (LVEF), mitral regurgitation severity, systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral leaflet, and resting and provoked LVOT gradients. All patients had a baseline LVEF of >55%. LVEF was preserved in 97.1% of patients over a mean follow-up time of 3.1Â±2.3 years (maximum 9.7). Mild LV systolic dysfunction was observed (LVEF range 44% to 54%) in only 4 patients. Mitral regurgitation severity improved in 67% (n=112 of 138 with complete data). Resting LVOT gradient declined from a mean of 75 to 19 mm Hg (p<0.001), and provoked gradient declined from a mean of 101 to 33 mm Hg (p<0.001). New York Heart Association class improved from a mean of 2.9Â±0.4 to 1.3Â±0.5 (p<0.001). In conclusion, LV systolic function is only mildly reduced in a minority of patients after ASA for symptomatic HC; other echocardiographic and functional measures were significantly improved.",

"Despite recent therapeutic advances, significant residual risk for in-hospital mortality persists among patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), a known independent predictor of increased cardiovascular events, may be an important modulator of heightened risk after acute MI. We evaluated admission HDL-C levels among 98,276 patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with acute MI from the Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry-Get With the Guidelines (ACTION Registry-GWTG) program who were enrolled from 490 United States hospitals from January 2007 to December 2010. Clinical characteristics, treatments, atherosclerotic burden, and in-hospital outcomes were analyzed by quartiles of admission HDL-C (Q1: 10 to 30 mg/dl; Q2: 30.1 to 36.9 mg/dl; Q3: 37 to 45 mg/dl; and Q4: 45.1 to 100 mg/dl). Logistic regression was used to explore the relation among HDL-C quartiles, coronary artery disease severity, and in-hospital mortality. Almost half of the patients with acute MI had low admission levels of HDL-C (less than the median 36.9 mg/dl). Such patients were younger, more often men, white, obese, diabetic, smokers, and had higher rates of previous cardiovascular events. After multivariate adjustment, patients with low HDL-C levels had greater extent of severe angiographic multivessel coronary narrowings and higher mortality. Among the 26% of patients in the lowest HDL-C quartile (â¤30 mg/dl), there was a 16% greater risk of in-hospital mortality compared with patients in the highest HDL-C quartile (pÂ = 0.012). In conclusion, low levels of HDL-C were common in patients admitted with acute MI and were associated with more extensive angiographic coronary disease. Very low levels of admission HDL-C were observed in one-quarter of patients and associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality.",

"This study aimed to examine practice patterns in the inpatient medical treatment of newborns and infants with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) using the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database, a large, multi-institutional administrative database. A retrospective examination of pediatric hospital discharge data was performed during the study period from January 2003 to September 2008. Data were extracted from the index hospitalization of all individuals younger than 1 year with the principal discharge diagnosis of SVT. Those with coexisting congenital or acquired structural heart disease were excluded from the study. The analysis included 171 patients. No deaths occurred, and 95 % of the infants were discharged to home. More than half (53 %) of the patients spent a portion of their hospital stay in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Multidrug therapy was common, with 45 % of the patients receiving two or more antiarrhythmic agents on the day of discharge. The five most commonly used antiarrhythmic drugs, in order of decreasing frequency of use, were propranolol, digoxin, amiodarone, flecainide, and sotalol. The median hospital stay for the group was 4 days, and this value increased as a function of the number of antiarrhythmic drugs used (median, 7 days for three or more agents) and the need for intensive care (median, 6 days). The information provided in this study helps to define common practice patterns and should allow caregivers to provide meaningful expectations to families regarding their potential treatment course and to anticipate the hospital length of stay.",

"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in postmenopausal women. While diet and lifestyle remain the cornerstones of prevention, a low-fat/high-carbohydrate diet is associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia-atherosclerotic risk factors affected by postprandial conditions. The objective of this study was to examine the acute response of lipids and insulin to a low-fat/high-carbohydrate meal with either a high-glycemic or a low-glycemic index in healthy postmenopausal women. Fifteen healthy postmenopausal women were enrolled in a randomized crossover dietary intervention study. Levels of glucose, triglyceride, free fatty acids (FFAs), and insulin were measured preprandially and for 240 minutes after consumption of the test meals. In response to the high-glycemic compared with the low-glycemic index meal, postprandial insulin levels had a higher peak (65.4 vs 48.1 microU/mL, respectively), the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was significantly higher (P=.014), serum triglyceride levels declined significantly (P<.001), and there was a small reduction in FFA levels, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. The results suggest a postprandial impact of glycemic index on cardiovascular metabolic biomarkers in postmenopausal women and may have implications for dietary glycemic modification of cardiovascular risk in women.",

"Xenin-25 (Xen) is a neurotensin-related peptide secreted by a subset of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)-producing enteroendocrine cells. In animals, Xen regulates gastrointestinal function and glucose homeostasis, typically by initiating neural relays. However, little is known about Xen action in humans. This study determines whether exogenously administered Xen modulates gastric emptying and/or insulin secretion rates (ISRs) following meal ingestion. Fasted subjects with normal (NGT) or impaired (IGT) glucose tolerance and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM; n = 10-14 per group) ingested a liquid mixed meal plus acetaminophen (ACM; to assess gastric emptying) at time zero. On separate occasions, a primed-constant intravenous infusion of vehicle or Xen at 4 (Lo-Xen) or 12 (Hi-Xen) pmol Â· kg(-1) Â· min(-1) was administered from zero until 300 min. Some subjects with NGT received 30- and 90-min Hi-Xen infusions. Plasma ACM, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, Xen, GIP, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels were measured and ISRs calculated. Areas under the curves were compared for treatment effects. Infusion with Hi-Xen, but not Lo-Xen, similarly delayed gastric emptying and reduced postprandial glucose levels in all groups. Infusions for 90 or 300 min, but not 30 min, were equally effective. Hi-Xen reduced plasma GLP-1, but not GIP, levels without altering the insulin secretory response to glucose. Intense staining for Xen receptors was detected on PGP9.5-positive nerve fibers in the longitudinal muscle of the human stomach. Thus Xen reduces gastric emptying in humans with and without T2DM, probably via a neural relay. Moreover, endogenous GLP-1 may not be a major enhancer of insulin secretion in healthy humans under physiological conditions.",

"This is a first of many phase 1 study of Ultratrace Iobenguane I-131 (Ultratrace 131I-MIBG; Molecular Insight Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, MA). High-specific-activity Ultratrace 131I-MIBG may provide improved efficacy and tolerability over carrier-added 131I-MIBG. We investigated the pharmacokinetics (PK), radiation dosimetry, and clinical safety in 11 patients with confirmed pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (Pheo) or carcinoid tumors. A single 5.0-mCi (185 MBq) injection of Ultratrace 131I-MIBG, supplemented with 185 microg of unlabeled MIBG to simulate the amount of MIBG anticipated in a therapeutic dose, was administered. Over 120 hours postdose, blood and urine were collected for PK, and sequential whole-body planar imaging was performed. Patients were followed for adverse events for 2 weeks. Ultratrace 131I-MIBG is rapidly cleared from the blood and excreted in urine (80.3% +/- 2.8% of dose at 120 hours). For a therapeutic administration of 500 mCi (18.5 GBq), our estimate of the projected dose is 1.4 Gy for marrow and 10.4 Gy for kidneys. Safety results showed 12 mild adverse events, all considered unrelated to study drug, in 8 of 11 patients. These findings support the further development of Ultratrace 131I-MIBG for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors, such as metastatic Pheo and carcinoid.",

"A role for vitamin A in host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been suggested through epidemiological and in vitro studies; however, the mechanism is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that vitamin A-triggered antimicrobial activity against M. tuberculosis requires expression of NPC2. Comparison of monocytes stimulated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3), the biologically active forms of vitamin A and vitamin D, respectively, indicates that ATRA and 1,25D3 induce mechanistically distinct antimicrobial activities. Stimulation of primary human monocytes with ATRA did not result in expression of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin, which is required for 1,25D3 antimicrobial activity. In contrast, ATRA triggered a reduction in the total cellular cholesterol concentration, whereas 1,25D3 did not. Blocking ATRA-induced cellular cholesterol reduction inhibits antimicrobial activity as well. Bioinformatic analysis of ATRA- and 1,25D3-induced gene profiles suggests that NPC2 is a key gene in ATRA-induced cholesterol regulation. Knockdown experiments demonstrate that ATRA-mediated decrease in total cellular cholesterol content and increase in lysosomal acidification are both dependent upon expression of NPC2. Expression of NPC2 was lower in caseous tuberculosis granulomas and M. tuberculosis-infected monocytes compared with normal lung and uninfected cells, respectively. Loss of NPC2 expression ablated ATRA-induced antimicrobial activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the vitamin A-mediated antimicrobial mechanism against M. tuberculosis requires NPC2-dependent expression and function, indicating a key role for cellular cholesterol regulation in the innate immune response.",
"The International Headache Society (IHS) criteria-based questionnaires were given to 647 college-going females (faculty and students) of selected universities in Lahore, Pakistan.

"The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of various pleurodesis procedures on post-operative morbidity and late recurrence rate after surgical treatment of Vanderschueren's stage III primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Between January 2001 and June 2004, 208 consecutive patients (169 male and 39 female; mean (range) age 25 (12-39) yrs) were submitted to 220 video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical procedures for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. All patients underwent apical lung resection; 112 were assigned at random to mechanical pleural abrasion (group A) and 108 to apical pleurectomy (group B). The two groups of patients showed similar characteristics. No intra- or post-operative deaths occurred. Post-operative morbidity was 6.25% for group A and 12.9% for group B; the two groups exhibited a similar persistent post-operative air leak rate (5.3% in group A and 5.5% in group B), whereas haemothorax was significantly more frequent after apical pleurectomy (eight (7.4%) cases) than after pleural abrasion (one (0.9%) case). The mean duration of follow-up was 46 (24-66) months. Late recurrence occurred in five cases (4.6%) after apical pleurectomy, and in seven (6.2%) after mechanical pleural abrasion. Mechanical pleural abrasion by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is safer than apical pleurectomy in the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. No differences in late recurrence rate were observed between the two procedures.",

"Belief and expectation are part of placebo effect. Migraine patients are characterized by a dysfunctional modulation of pain processing, though a clear placebo effect emerges in clinical trials. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of visual and verbal suggestion on subjective pain sensation and cortical responses evoked by CO2 painful laser stimuli in migraine without aura patients vs healthy controls. Twenty-six patients were recorded during the inter-ictal phase and compared to 26 sex and age-matched controls. The right hand and the right supraorbital zone were stimulated during a not conditioned and a conditioned task, where laser stimuli were delivered after a verbal and visual cues of decreased (D), increased (I) or basal (B) intensity, which was left unmodified during the entire task. In control subjects pain rating changed, according to the announced intensity, while in migraine patients the basal hyper-algesia remained unmodified. The N1 and N2 amplitudes tended to change coherently with the stimulus cue in controls, while an opposite paradoxical increase in decreasing condition emerged in migraine. The P2 amplitude modulation was also reduced in migraine, differently from controls. The altered pattern of pain rating and N2 amplitude modulation concurred with frequency of migraine, disability and allodynia. In controls suggestion influenced cortical pain processing and subjective pain rating, while in migraine a peculiar pattern of cortical activation contrasted external cues in order to maintain the basal hyper-algesia. This scarce influence of induced suggestion on pain experience seemed to characterize patients with more severe migraine and central sensitization.",

"Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is gaining popularity because of its well-documented benefits. The aim of our study was to see if a decreased intraoperative intraabdominal pressure during laparoscopic adrenalectomy would affect the hemodynamic variables and the serum levels of catecholamines. We randomly divided 9 patients into 2 groups, maintaining either an intraabdominal pressure of 15 mm Hg (group A) or 8-10 mm Hg (group B). Norepinephrine and epinephrine blood levels were measured preoperatively, during endotracheal intubation, carboperitoneum, surgical manipulation of tumor just before the ligation of the adrenal vein, and tracheal extubation; the hemodynamic variables were recorded. The introduction of carboperitoneum resulted in an increase in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), although it was statistically insignificant. The norepinephrine levels showed a statistically significant increase in group A as compared with group B (P = 0.0002). Surgical manipulation of the tumor resulted in a significant increase in MAP and norepinephrine levels in group A (P = 0.007 and P = 0.0001, respectively). The epinephrine levels did not change as much because the tumor was probably predominantly norepinephrine-secreting. Norepinephrine levels continued to be high even during tracheal extubation in group A patients (P = 0.027). We conclude that a low intraabdominal pressure of 8-10 mm Hg causes less catecholamine release and fewer hemodynamic fluctuations.",

"With advent of transcatheter aortic valve implantation, using multislice computed tomography (MSCT) to provide detailed data about aortic root has become more crucial. We compared aortic dimension changes during cardiac cycle in patients with and without aortic valve calcification and evaluated its correlation with aortic valve calcium score in former group. Fifty-two patients with and 52 subjects without aortic valve calcification underwent coronary MSCT using two 64-slice and a dual-source 256-slice CT scanners. Aortic root dimensions were measured in both systolic and diastolic phases. Changes in annular maximum diameter (D(max)), minimum diameter (D(min)), cross sectional area and perimeter, three diameters of sinuses of Valsalva (V(a), V(b) and V(c)), sinotubular junction maximum (STJ(max)) and minimum (STJ(min)) diameters between systolic and diastolic phases (systole minus diastole) were -0.59 mm, -0.05 mm, -2.53 mm(2), -1.48 mm, +0.91 mm, +1.08 mm, +0.42 mm, +0.63 mm, +0.40 mm and in those without aortic calcification -0.33 mm, 0.00 mm, -6.92 mm(2), -0.41 mm, +0.30 mm, +0.38 mm, +0.61 mm, +0.33 mm, +0.20 mm in patients with aortic calcification, respectively. Apart from two diameters in sinuses of Valsalva (V(a) and V(b)), changes in all other diameters of aortic root during cardiac cycle were not significantly different between the two groups. Furthermore, in patients with aortic calcification, no significant correlation was detected between changes in nearly all aortic root dimensions during cardiac cycle and aortic valve calcium score or location of calcification (annular, commissural or both).",

"Echocardiography-guided left ventricular (LV) lead placement at the site of latest mechanical activation improves heart failure outcomes in patients receiving a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D). In this study, we test the hypothesis that a strategy of echocardiography-guided LV lead placement improves patient survival rate free from appropriate CRT-D therapy for ventricular arrhythmias. Patients enrolled in the prospective, randomized Speckle Tracking Assisted Resynchronization Therapy for Electrode Region trial and treated with a CRT-D device (108 with the echo-guided strategy and 75 with the routine strategy) were followed to the end point of death or first appropriate CRT-D therapy. Over a follow-up period of 3.7 Â± 2.1Â years, 62 patients (33%) died and 40Â (22%) received appropriate CRT-D therapy. Compared with the routine group, patients in the echo-guided group had improved CRT-D therapy-free survival rate (hazard ratioÂ = 0.64, 95% confidence intervalÂ = 0.42 to 0.98, pÂ = 0.038). Patients randomized to the echo-guided LV lead placement were more likely to resynchronize their LV compared with the routine group (72% vs 48%, respectively, pÂ = 0.006). Patients whose LV did resynchronize after CRT-D had improved therapy-free survival rate compared with those whose LV did not resynchronize (hazard ratioÂ = 0.49, 95% confidence intervalÂ = 0.28 to 0.86, pÂ = 0.012). In conclusion, a strategy of echo-guided LV lead placement improved the patient survival rate free from defibrillator therapy in CRT-D recipients.",

"This was an open-label, nonrandomized, 2-center study conducted to assess the influence of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of hydroxyurea in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD). Seventeen patients were divided into 5 groups: normal renal function (n = 7), mild renal impairment (n = 2), moderate renal impairment (n = 3), severe renal impairment (n = 2), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD, n = 3). Except for patients with ESRD, all the patients received a 15-mg/kg single oral dose of hydroxyurea. Patients with ESRD received a 15-mg/kg oral dose of hydroxyurea on 2 occasions. Blood and urine samples were collected for the assessment of hydroxyurea pharmacokinetics. The results indicate that the systemic exposure increases and the urinary recovery decreases as the degree of renal insufficiency worsens. On the basis of the exposure and the apparent clearance from the current and 2 historical studies, the authors have proposed an initial dosing regimen of hydroxyurea (7.5 mg/kg/day) for SCD patients with CL(cr) <60 mL/min. This dosing strategy is anticipated to provide a safe dose for SCD patients with renal impairment.",

"Pulmonary hypertension includes heterogeneous diagnoses with distinct hemodynamic pathophysiologic features. Identifying elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is critical for appropriate treatment. We reviewed data from patients seen at referral pulmonary hypertension clinics who had undergone echocardiography and right-side cardiac catheterization within 1 year. We derived equations to estimate PVR using the ratio of estimated pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure (PASPDoppler) to right ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral (VTI). We validated these equations in a separate sample and compared them with a published model based on the ratio of the transtricuspid flow velocity to right ventricular outflow tract VTI (model 1, Abbas et al 2003). The derived models were as follows: PVR = 1.2 Ã (PASP/right ventricular outflow tract VTI) (model 2) and PVR = (PASP/right ventricular outflow tract VTI) + 3 if notch present (model 3). The cohort included 217 patients with mean PA pressure of 45.3 Â± 11.9 mm Hg, PVR of 7.3 Â± 5.0 WU, and PA wedge pressure of 14.8 Â± 8.1 mm Hg. Just >1/3 had a PA wedge pressure >15 mm Hg (35.5%) and 82.0% had PVR >3 WU. Model 1 systematically underestimated catheterization estimated PVR, especially for those with high PVR. The derived models demonstrated no systematic bias. Model 3 correlated best with PVR (r = 0.80 vs r = 0.73 and r = 0.77 for models 1 and 2, respectively). Model 3 had superior discriminatory power for PVR >3 WU (area under the curve 0.946) and PVR >5 WU (area under the curve 0.924), although all models discriminated well. Model 3-estimated PVR >3 was 98.3% sensitive and 61.1% specific for PVR >3 WU (positive predictive value 93%; negative predictive value 88%). In conclusion, we present an equation to estimate the PVR, using the ratio of PASPDoppler to right ventricular outflow tract VTI and a constant designating presence of right ventricular outflow tract VTI midsystolic notching, which provides superior agreement with catheterization estimates of PVR across a wide range of values.",

"The currently recommended doses of rifampin are believed to be at the lower end of the dose-response curve. Rifampin induces its own metabolism, although the effect of dose on the extent of autoinduction is not known. This study aimed to investigate rifampin autoinduction using a semimechanistic pharmacokinetic-enzyme turnover model. Four different structural basic models were explored to assess whether different scaling methods affected the final covariate selection procedure. Covariates were selected by using a linearized approach. The final model included the allometric scaling of oral clearance and apparent volume of distribution. Although HIV infection was associated with a 30% increase in the apparent volume of distribution, simulations demonstrated that the effect of HIV on rifampin exposure was slight. Model-based simulations showed close-to-maximum induction achieved after 450-mg daily dosing, since negligible increases in oral clearance were observed following the 600-mg/day regimen. Thus, dosing above 600 mg/day is unlikely to result in higher magnitudes of autoinduction. In a typical 55-kg male without HIV infection, the oral clearance, which was 7.76 liters Â· hâ»Â¹ at the first dose, increased 1.82- and 1.85-fold at steady state after daily dosing with 450 and 600 mg, respectively. Corresponding reductions of 41 and 42%, respectively, in the area under the concentration-versus-time curve from 0 to 24 h were estimated. The turnover of the inducible process was estimated to have a half-life of approximately 8 days in a typical patient. Assuming 5 half-lives to steady state, this corresponds to a duration of approximately 40 days to reach the induced state for rifampin autoinduction.",

"Clinical data from a total of 164 babies with severe respiratory distress syndrome treated with a single dose of porcine surfactant (Curosurf, 200 mg/kg body weight) were subjected to multiple regression analysis in order to identify factors influencing the response to replacement therapy. At entry all babies were being treated with artificial ventilation, requiring at least 60% oxygen; the first 77 babies were part of a controlled trial, and an additional 87 babies were treated without controls once the benefit of surfactant therapy had been established. Both series of patients showed a sustained doubling of the mean arterial/alveolar oxygen tension ratio (a/APO2) after treatment with surfactant. Mortality was only 15% in the new series of treated patients, and the number of survivors without evidence of chronic lung disease after 28 days remained twice as high as that of the control group in the randomized study (55% vs. 26%; P less than 0.001). High fraction of inspired oxygen requirement at entry had a negative impact on a/APO2 6 h and 24 h after treatment. The duration of artificial ventilation and total time in greater than 21% oxygen were lower in heavier babies, who also had a lower mortality. Male and outborn babies had a higher mortality. Perinatal asphyxia (Apgar score less than 7 at 5 min) and high airway pressure requirement at entry were associated with increased mortality. Hospital allocation had a significant impact on all dependent variables. We also analysed the incidence of complications in relation to the therapeutic response pattern.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",
"In heart, the type 2 inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (InsP3R2) is the predominant isoform expressed and is localized in the nuclear membrane of ventricular myocytes. InsP3R2-mediated Ca(2+) release regulates hypertrophy specific gene expression by modulating CaMKIIÎ´, histone deacetylase, and calcineurin-NFATc signaling pathways. InsP3R2 protein is a hypertrophy specific marker and is overexpressed in heart failure animal models and in humans. However, the regulation of InsP3R2 mRNA and protein expression during cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure is not known. Here we show the transcriptional regulation of the Itpr2 gene in adult cardiomyocytes. Our data demonstrates that, InsP3R2 mRNA and protein expression is activated by hypertrophic agonists and attenuated by InsP3R inhibitors 2-aminoethoxyldiphenyl borate and xestospongin-C. The Itpr2 promoter is regulated by the calcineurin-NFATc signaling pathway. NFATc1 regulates Itpr2 gene expression by directly binding to the Itpr2 promoter. The calcineurin-NFATc mediated up-regulation of the Itpr2 promoter was attenuated by cyclosporine-A. InsP3R2 mRNA and protein expression was up-regulated in calcineurin-A transgenic mice and in human heart failure. Collectively, our data suggests that ITPR2 and hypertrophy specific gene expression is regulated, in part, by a positive feedback regulation between InsP3R2 and calcineurin-NFATc signaling pathways.",

"Renal dysfunction is related to long-term mortality and myocardial infarction after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). We aimed to investigate the association between preoperative renal dysfunction and early risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure after CABG. From the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies registry, we included all 36,284 patients who underwent primary isolated CABG from 2000 to 2008 in Sweden. The Swedish National Inpatient Registry was used to obtain the primary end point, which was rehospitalization for stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure â¤90 days after CABG. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the risk for the primary outcome and the secondary outcome of death from any cause, while adjusting for confounders. During 90 days of follow-up, there were 2,462 cardiovascular events and 617 deaths. In total, 17% of patients developed acute kidney injury postoperatively. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for cardiovascular events after adjustment for age, gender, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection fraction, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke was 1.24 (1.06 to 1.45) in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 45 ml/min/1.73 m(2) but became nonsignificant after acute kidney injury was introduced into the statistical model. The risk of death was significantly increased in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15 to 45 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (odds ratio 1.76, 95% confidence interval 1.38 to 2.25) even after adjustment for all confounders.

"The patients who chose to participate in this study may be a cohort of well-controlled patients with diabetes mellitus. The type of procedure performed was determined by a clinical decision and not randomized. The different routes of administration and diagnosis of failed back surgery syndrome can result in different levels of systemic absorption, thereby influencing the degree and duration of hyperglycemia. In patients with FBSS, the epidural space may be destructed by surgery and adhesive changes in epidural space could be extensive. Therefore, we thought that the absorption of epidural space in these patients would be incomplete or slow compared with those without FBSS.",

"The objective of this study is to assess patients' satisfaction with migraine treatment with frovatriptan (F) or zolmitriptan (Z), by preference questionnaire. 133 subjects with a history of migraine with or without aura (IHS criteria) were randomized to F 2.5 mg or Z 2.5 mg. The study had a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, with each of the two treatment periods lasting no more than 3 months. At the end of the study, patients were asked to assign preference to one of the treatments (primary endpoint). The number of pain-free (PF) and pain-relief (PR) episodes at 2 h, and number of recurrent and sustained pain-free (SPF) episodes within 48 h were the secondary study endpoints. Seventy-seven percent of patients expressed a preference. Average score of preference was 2.9 +/- 1.3 (F) versus 3.0 +/- 1.3 (Z; p = NS). Rate of PF episodes at 2 h was 26% with F and 31% with Z (p = NS). PR episodes at 2 h were 57% for F and 58% for Z (p = NS). Rate of recurrence was 21 (F) and 24% (Z; p = NS). Time to recurrence within 48 h was better for F especially between 4 and 16 h (p < 0.05). SPF episodes were 18 (F) versus 22% (Z; p = NS). Drug-related adverse events were significantly (p < 0.05) less under F (3 vs. 10). In conclusion, our study suggests that F has a similar efficacy of Z, with some advantage as regards tolerability and recurrence.",

"Aims In the last decade, several approaches to ablating triggers and substrates of atrial fibrillation (AF) have been developed. However, most studies have reported data only on short- or medium-term follow-up. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the 1-year efficacy of catheter ablation for AF is predictive of long-term clinical success. Methods and results Between February 2001 and October 2003, 229 consecutive patients affected by drug-refractory paroxysmal or persistent AF underwent a single radiofrequency catheter ablation procedure (anatomical approach in 146 patients and electrophysiologically guided approach in 83 patients). Of these patients, 177 (mean age 59.1 +/- 10.5 years, 57.6% with paroxysmal AF) were free from any atrial arrhythmia recurrence after 12 months. These 177 patients were subsequently followed up for at least another 24 months, by means of electrocardiogram and 24 h Holter monitoring. After a mean follow-up of 49.7 +/- 13.3 months (range 36-83 months), 58.2% of the patients were free from any atrial arrhythmia recurrence (39.5% without antiarrhythmic drugs). The actuarial atrial arrhythmia recurrence rate was 13.0% at 2 years, 21.8% at 3 years, 35.0% at 4 years, 46.8% at 5 years, and 54.6% at 6 years. Atrial arrhythmia-free survival was similar in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF, with and without antiarrhythmic drugs during the follow-up, who underwent electrophysiologically guided pulmonary vein (PV) isolation or anatomical PV ablation. Conclusion Even patients in whom catheter ablation prevents AF recurrence for 1 year should not be considered 'cured', since >40% of them will suffer AF recurrence over a long-term clinical follow-up.",
"We conducted a case-control study to investigate risk factors for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in the People's Republic of China. Genotyping analysis was used to estimate the percentage of cases from recent transmission among 100 MDR TB case-patients hospitalized during April 2007-July 2009. Molecular subtyping of isolates showed that 41% of MDR TB strains clustered. Beijing genotype was found in 94% of the MDR TB isolates and 79% of the pan-susceptible isolates. In multivariate analysis, MDR TB was independently associated with Beijing genotype, retreatment for TB, symptoms lasting >3 months before first evaluation at the hospital, lack of health insurance, and being a farmer (vs. being a student). MDR TB was associated with Beijing genotype and lower socioeconomic status. A large percentage of MDR TB cases seemed to result from recent transmission. Early detection, effective treatment, and infection control measures for MDR TB are needed to reduce transmission.",

"In a randomized multicenter trial, involving the collaboration of eight European neonatal intensive care units, the efficacy of replacement therapy with a new surfactant preparation (Curosurf) was tested in 146 patients with severe neonatal respiratory distress syndrome. Criteria for entry included birth weight 700 to 2,000 g, age when treated two to 15 hours, and requirement of artificial ventilation with FiO2 greater than or equal to 0.6. The babies were treated with a single large dose of surfactant (200 mg/kg) at a median age of nine hours (range two to 15 hours). Average FiO2 before treatment was the same (0.80) for both surfactant-treated patients and control patients. Babies receiving surfactant showed, within five minutes, a dramatic improvement of oxygenation as reflected by a nearly threefold increase of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Six hours after randomization, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio still showed a 98% improvement in surfactant-treated patients compared with controls (P less than .001), and statistically significant differences in favor of the treated babies persisted until 48 hours after randomization, when surviving control infants began to recover. Treatment with surfactant decreased neonatal (less than or equal to 28 days) mortality from 51% to 31% (P less than .05). Compared with control babies, the surfactant-treated group also had a decreased incidence of pulmonary interstitial emphysema (23% v 39%; P less than .05) and pneumothorax (18% v 35%; P less than .05). The percentage of survivors without bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the treated group was more than twice that of the control group (55% v 26%; P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

"We report the discovery and translational therapeutic efficacy of a peptide with potent, balanced co-agonism at both of the receptors for the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). This unimolecular dual incretin is derived from an intermixed sequence of GLP-1 and GIP, and demonstrated enhanced antihyperglycemic and insulinotropic efficacy relative to selective GLP-1 agonists. Notably, this superior efficacy translated across rodent models of obesity and diabetes, including db/db mice and ZDF rats, to primates (cynomolgus monkeys and humans). Furthermore, this co-agonist exhibited synergism in reducing fat mass in obese rodents, whereas a selective GIP agonist demonstrated negligible weight-lowering efficacy. The unimolecular dual incretins corrected two causal mechanisms of diabesity, adiposity-induced insulin resistance and pancreatic insulin deficiency, more effectively than did selective mono-agonists. The duration of action of the unimolecular dual incretins was refined through site-specific lipidation or PEGylation to support less frequent administration. These peptides provide comparable pharmacology to the native peptides and enhanced efficacy relative to similarly modified selective GLP-1 agonists. The pharmacokinetic enhancement lessened peak drug exposure and, in combination with less dependence on GLP-1-mediated pharmacology, avoided the adverse gastrointestinal effects that typify selective GLP-1-based agonists. This discovery and validation of a balanced and high-potency dual incretin agonist enables a more physiological approach to management of diseases associated with impaired glucose tolerance.",

"We have previously demonstrated that 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) augments fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in patients with sickle cell anemia (SS) who did not respond to hydroxyurea (HU). The present study was designed to determine the effect of repeated decitabine dosing on HbF levels and hematologic toxicity over a 9-month treatment period. Seven patients (5 HU nonresponders) were entered. One patient had alpha-thalassemia sickle cell anemia. Decitabine was administered by intravenous infusion at a starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg per day, 5 days a week for 2 weeks, followed by a 4-week observation period. If the absolute neutrophil count dropped below 1000, the dose was reduced by 0.05 mg/kg per day in the next cycle. A drug dose was obtained for each patient, and it resulted in an elevated HbF without neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count nadir greater than 1500) or evidence of cumulative toxicity. Average HbF and average maximal HbF levels attained during the last 20 weeks of treatment for the 6 SS patients increased to 13.93% +/- 2.75% and 18.35% +/- 4.46%, respectively, from a pretreatment mean of 3.12% +/- 2.75%. Mean and mean maximal hemoglobin (Hb) levels increased from 7.23 +/- 2.35 g/dL to 8.81 +/- 0.42 g/dL and 9.73 +/- 0.53 g/dL, respectively. Individual maximal F-cell number observed during the trial was 69% +/- 10.12%. The absence of cumulative toxicity may allow shorter intervals between drug treatments, which may lead to higher hemoglobin and HbF levels after several treatment cycles and, therefore, to greater clinical improvement.",

"Several clinical and procedural factors have been identified as predictors of early and midterm events after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), but incidence and prognostic impact of diabetes mellitus (DM), especially insulin treated, on short- and midterm outcomes remain to be defined. All consecutive patients who underwent TAVI at our institutions were enrolled and stratified according to DM status. All-cause mortality at 30 days or in hospital and at follow-up was the primary end point, whereas periprocedural complications, rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and reintervention at follow-up were the secondary ones. All end points were adjudicated according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium definitions. In all, 511 patients were enrolled: 361 without DM, 78 with orally treated DM, and 72 with insulin-treated DM. Orally treated DM patients were more frequently women, whereas insulin-treated DM patients were younger. Thirty-day Valve Academic Research Consortium mortality was not significantly higher in patients with orally treated DM and insulin-treated DM compared with patients without diabetes (6.4%, 9.7%, and 4.7%, p = 0.09). Bleedings, vascular complications, postprocedural acute kidney injury, and periprocedural strokes were not significantly different in the 3 groups. At midterm follow-up (median 400 days), patients with insulin-treated DM had a significantly higher mortality rate (33.3% vs 18.6%, p = 0.01) and higher myocardial infarction incidence (8.3% vs 1.4%, p = 0.002) if compared with patients without diabetes. Strokes and reinterventions at follow-up were similar in the 3 groups. After multivariable adjustment, insulin-treated DM was independently correlated with death (hazard ratio 2, 95% confidence interval 1.3 to 3.3) and myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 3.73, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 13). In conclusion, DM does not significantly affect rates of complications in patients who underwent TAVI. Insulin-treated DM, but not orally treated DM, is independently associated with death and myocardial infarction at midterm follow-up and should be included into future TAVI-dedicated scores.",

"Screening for latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) in contacts of identified cases of tuberculosis should be based on intention to treat. We know that only LTBI that is attributable to a recent transmission requires preventive treatment in immunocompetent adults. There is no current test that allows accurate dating of LTBI. The objective of this retrospective study with QuantiFERON-TB-Gold In-Tube (QFT) is to estimate the probability of recent LTBI in various groups of contacts. Among 2424 subjects included, 407 (17%) tests were positive; 129 (28%) within the family circle, 69 (19%) within the social environment, 153 (14%) among professional acquaintances and 56 (10%) within the school environment (respectively: OR=0.69 and P=0.04; OR=0.49 and P<0.001; OR=0.51 and P<0.001). After comparison with a basal rate of LTBI, professional and family contacts less than 40 years old, born in a country of incidence lower than 20, had a rate of recent LTBI between 15 and 40% and between 68 and 80%, respectively. For those born in a country of incidence greater than 20, we estimate the rate of recent LTBI between 6 and 18% for professional contacts and between 43 and 50% for family contacts. These results, although approximate and specific to Paris, are important for the clinician who has to decide on preventive treatment and for the public health specialist who has to identify groups of contacts. Finally, to limit the differences in rates of recent LTBI, it would probably be necessary to specify thresholds of accumulated contact time, according to the type of contact, before considering an individual as a contact.",

"Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with higher prevalent blood pressure. We tested whether high-dose intermittent oral vitamin D therapy could reduce blood pressure and left ventricular mass in patients with hypertension resistant to conventional treatment. We conducted a parallel-group, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial. Patients with supine office blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg on â¥3 antihypertensive agents received 100 000 U oral vitamin D3 or matching placebo every 2 months. Office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol were measured at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months; left ventricular mass index was measured by cardiac MRI on a subgroup at baseline and 6 months. The primary outcome was mean 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure at 6 months. A total of 68 participants were randomized, 34 in each group. Mean age was 63 (SD 11) years, mean baseline office blood pressure was 154/84 (13/10) mm Hg, and mean baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was 42 (16) nmol/L. Treatment with vitamin D did not reduce 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (adjusted treatment effects: systolic, +3 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -4 to +11; P=0.33; diastolic, -2 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -6 to +2; P=0.29); similar results were seen for office blood pressure.

After 1 h with placebo or rhIL-6, a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp was initiated. Whole body glucose metabolism was measured using stable isotope-labeled tracers. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression were measured in muscle biopsies. Whole body energy expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry. In response to the infusion of rhIL-6, circulating levels of IL-6 (P < 0.001), neutrophils (P < 0.001), and cortisol (P < 0.001) increased while lymphocytes decreased (P < 0.01). However, IL-6 infusion did not change glucose infusion rate, rate of appearance, or rate of disappearance during the clamp. While IL-6 enhanced phosphorylation of STAT3 in skeletal muscle (P = 0.041), the expression of SOCS3 remained unchanged. Whole body oxygen uptake (P < 0.01) and expired carbon dioxide (P < 0.01) increased during rhIL-6 infusion. In summary, although IL-6 induced local and systemic responses, the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was not affected. While different contributing factors may be involved, our results are in contrast to our hypothesis and previous findings in young, healthy men.",

"In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) reduced crisis rates in adult patients with severe sickle cell anemia. No serious acute toxicity was seen, but the safety of long-term therapy could not be evaluated. The rationale for the use of HU was based on its ability to increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) synthesis and the inhibitory effect of HbF on polymerization of sickle cell hemoglobin. Surprisingly, final HbF levels in patients assigned to HU did not differ markedly from their pretreatment levels (5% v 9%). As Steinberg et al showed, when HU patients were divided into quartiles based on final HbF levels, those in the highest quartile had an 18% mean HbF, while those in the lowest quartile had a mean of only 4%. Higher HbF levels were associated with lower crisis rates, but the association was not statistically significant. Further analyses suggested noncompliance of patients in the lower HbF quartiles in the later months of the study as a significant factor responsible for the difference in HbF levels. When HU patients were divided into quartiles based on their 2-year crisis rates, those with the fewest crises had lower neutrophil counts and higher mean corpuscular volumes (MCVs) and F-cell counts; similar but less marked changes were seen in patients assigned to placebo. Multivariable analyses showed a significant relationship between crisis rate and, in the early months of the study, F-cell count and, in later months, MCV. Lower neutrophil counts were associated with lower crisis rates in all months of the study. The HbF in F cells inhibits their sickling and decreases the likelihood of vaso-occlusion and infarction. If infarction does occur, lower neutrophil counts may limit the extent of tissue destruction and the severity of pain. Further study is needed to clarify the interplay of these two factors as mediators of the effect of HU in lowering crisis rates in sickle cell anemia.",

"The purpose of this study was to assess both the benefits of a 3-month travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5%fixed combination (trav/tim) regimen in comparison with previous medications for the control of intraocular pressure (IOP) and the tolerability of these drug regimens in glaucoma patients. An observational, non-interventional, open-label study of 406 eyes with primary open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension was thus undertaken. One drop of trav/tim fixed combination was administered in the evening for 3 months. Patients were divided into five groups according to previous drug regimens: timolol 0.5% monotherapy; betaxolol 0.5% monotherapy; latanoprost 0.005% monotherapy; travoprost 0.004% monotherapy; and dorzolamide 2%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination. Upon medication substitution, the trav/tim fixed combination provided better IOP control and tolerability in all five patient groups. At the 3-month follow up, the mean IOP changes from previous therapy were as follows: 5.2 Â± 2.7 mmHg (20.8% change) in timolol 0.5% group; 5.7 Â± 2.2 mmHg (22.5% change) in betaxolol 0.5% group; 3.8 Â± 2.6 mmHg (24.5% change) in latanoprost 0.005% group; 4.4 Â± 2.8 mmHg (20% change) in travoprost 0.004% group; and 3.4 Â± 4.1 mmHg (14.5% change) in dorzolamide 2%/timolol 0.5% fixed combination group. The difference between baseline and trav/tim combination patient satisfaction at the 3-month follow-up was significant. Thus, the trav/tim fixed combination provided better IOP control and tolerability than previous mono- or polytherapies.",
"Despite adverse side effects, phenoxybenzamine has been widely used for the preoperative management of patients with pheochromocytoma. Doxazosin, a specific a 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, has a pharmacologic profile more suited to controlling blood pressure in such patients. A sequential study of 35 patients with pheochromocytoma encompassed a definite and prescribed change in preoperative drug management from phenoxybenzamine to doxazosin. Hemodynamic, pharmacologic, and biochemical indicators of a- and b-adrenoceptor blockade were measured before, during, and after anesthesia and surgery in 8 patients pretreated with phenoxybenzamine and 27 patients pretreated with doxazosin. Doxazosin (2-16 mg/day) was as effective as phenoxybenzamine in controlling arterial pressure and heart rate before and during surgery, but doxazosin caused fewer undesirable side effects both before and after surgery. Following phenoxybenzamine therapy substantial a 1-adrenoceptor blockade, detected as a right shift of phenylephrine dose-response curves, persisted for more than 2 days postoperatively, whereas after doxazosin it was undetectable on the first postoperative day. Doxazosin provided safe, efficacious pre- and perioperative control of arterial pressure. In patients with predominantly norepinephrine-secreting tumors, pretreatment 24-hour urinary norepinephrine excretion gave an indication of the daily doxazosin requirement.",
"In a prospective comparison, 60 patients suffering from complicated spontaneous pneumothorax were randomly allocated to receive treatment by a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) technique or by thoracotomy. Thirty patients underwent bullectomy and apical pleurectomy by VATS performed through three 2-cm incisions (group V) and 30 patients underwent a similar surgical procedure through a posterolateral thoracotomy (group T). The median operating time was significantly longer in group V (45 versus 37.5 minutes; p < 0.05), but the postoperative analgesic requirement and hospital stay were less than those in group T. On the third postoperative day, the reductions in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity were significantly lower in group V than in group T (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Initial treatment of the spontaneous pneumothorax was effective in 27 patients (90%) in group V and in 29 patients (97%) in group T. There have been two late recurrences in group V and one in group T at a median follow-up of 15.1 months and 16.3 months, respectively. Within the study group, 30 consecutive patients presented with primary spontaneous pneumothorax. In this subgroup there was no significant difference in the operating time between VATS and thoracotomy, but postoperative pain, hospital stay, and pulmonary dysfunction were all less for those undergoing VATS. All treatment failures were in the subgroup of 30 consecutive patients who presented with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, and the hospital stay in this group was prolonged by the use of VATS. We conclude from our findings that VATS is superior to thoracotomy in the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

"Abnormal blood flow accounts for most of the clinical morbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD) [1,2]. Most notably, occlusion of flow in the microvasculature causes the acute pain crises [3] that are the commonest cause for patients with SCD to seek medical attention [4] and major determinants of their quality of life [5]. Based on evidence that endothelial P-selectin is central to the abnormal blood flow in SCD we provide results from four of our studies that are germane to microvascular blood flow in SCD. A proof-of-principle study established that doses of heparin lower than what are used for anticoagulation but sufficient to block P-selectin improved microvascular blood flow inpatients with SCD. An in vitro study showed that Pentosan Polysulfate Sodium (PPS) had greater P-selectin blocking activity than heparin. A Phase I clinical study demonstrated that a single oral dose of PPS increased microvascular blood flow in patients with SCD. A Phase II clinical study that was not completed documented that daily oral doses of PPS administered for 8 weeks lowered plasma levels of sVCAM-1 and tended to improve microvascular blood flow in patients with SCD. These data support the concept that P-selectin on the microvascular endothelium is critical to both acute vascular occlusion and chronically impaired microvascular blood flow in SCD. They also demonstrate that oral PPS is beneficial to microvascular sickle cell blood flow and has potential as an efficacious agent for long-term prophylactic therapy of SCD.",

"There are limited data regarding the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in arterial hypertension. The aim of the present study was to determine some markers of vascular function, including VEGF, active renin and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in patients with endocrine hypertension. The study comprised: 30 patients with primary aldosteronism; 32 patients with active Cushing's syndrome; 19 patients with pheochromocytoma; 22 patients with essential hypertension and 24 healthy volunteers. VEGF was significantly elevated in all groups of patients as compared to the controls. VEGF levels in patients with Cushing's syndrome were significantly higher than those in patients with essential hypertension and primary aldosteronism. We did not find significant differences in VEGF levels between patients with Conn adenomas and idiopathic aldosteronism as well as between patients with Cushing's disease and Cushing's syndrome. PGE2 levels were not significantly different among the groups. Active renin was significantly the lowest in patients with primary aldosteronism and significantly the highest in those with pheochromocytoma compared to controls. The level of active renin in patients with primary aldosteronism was significantly lower than in patients with Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytoma. In conclusion, VEGF levels were significantly elevated in patients with endocrine hypertension due to glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid and/or catecholamine excess. The highest VEGF levels were detected in patients with Cushing's syndrome. The latter is associated with accelerated development of atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk. VEGF might contribute to the cardiovascular risk in this disease. This effect was not likely to be PGE2 mediated.",
"Prasugrel is more potent than clopidogrel, but it is not known whether this translates into clinical benefit in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bivalirudin for ST elevation myocardial infarction. In the Intracoronary Abciximab and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients With Large Anterior Myocardial Infarction trial, 452 patients with anterior STEMI undergoing primary PCI with bivalirudin were randomized to intralesional abciximab or placebo and to thrombus aspiration or no aspiration. Clopidogrel or prasugrel were administered at physician discretion. The primary end point was infarct size at 30Â days by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical events at 30Â days and 1Â year were independently adjudicated. Propensity score was used to adjust for nonrandom allocation of the drugs. Prasugrel and clopidogrel were administered to 155 patients (34.3%) and 297 patients (65.7%), respectively. Patients receiving prasugrel were younger with higher left ventricular ejection fraction and greater use of drug-eluting stents. Prasugrel-treated patients had higher rates of procedural success (94% vs 89%, pÂ = 0.03), Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow (95% vs 90%, pÂ = 0.06), and lower corrected TIMI frame counts (21 Â± 6 vs 23 Â± 11, pÂ = 0.008). At 30Â days, infarct size was marginally lower in the prasugrel group (median [interquartile range]Â = 16.4% [6.5 to 20.0] vs 17.6% [8.1 to 25.7], pÂ = 0.06). At 1Â year, prasugrel group had significantly fewer deaths (1.3% vs 8.3%, pÂ = 0.004) and fewer episodes of severe heart failure (2.0% vs 7.7%, pÂ = 0.02). These findings persisted after propensity score adjustment. There were no significant differences in major bleeding. Stent thrombosis was 0% versus 2.5%, respectively, pÂ = 0.054. We conclude that prasugrel was associated with improved efficacy and similar safety compared with clopidogrel in patients undergoing primary PCI with bivalirudin.",

"This randomized, double-blind trial compared cardioversion rates between AZD7009 infusion (15-minute 3.25 mg/min, 15-minute 4.4 mg/min, or 30-minute 3.25 mg/min) and placebo infusion (15 or 30 minutes) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) scheduled for DC cardioversion. One hundred sixty-eight patients were randomized, 167 received study treatment, and 159 were included in perprotocol analyses. The mean duration of current AF episode was 47 days (range, 0.8-92). In the AZD7009 30-minute 3.25 mg/min group, 21 of 42 patients converted within 90 minutes, compared with 7 of 39, 7 of 36, and 0 of 42 patients in the 15-minute 3.25 mg/min, 15-minute 4.4 mg/min, and combined placebo groups, respectively. Patients not converted within 90 minutes underwent DC cardioversion. In patients with AF episodes </=30 days, conversion rates with AZD7009 30-minute 3.25 mg/min and after placebo followed by DC cardioversion were 82% and 83%, respectively. AZD7009 was generally well tolerated. Mean QTc increased by 15% to 20% in the AZD7009 treatment groups. One patient experienced a ventricular tachyarrhythmia of 7 beats, with features of torsades de pointes. AZD7009 was associated with a 50% conversion rate in the best-dose group. In patients with AF episodes <or=30 days, the conversion rates after AZD1305 and placebo followed by DC cardioversion were observed to be similar.",
"Patients with persistent AF, symptomatic HF, and LV ejection fraction <50% were randomized to catheter ablation or medical rate control.

"Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) is a powerful method for assessing the efficacy of anti-malaria vaccines and drugs targeting pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic stages of the parasite. CHMI has heretofore required the bites of 5 Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-infected mosquitoes to reliably induce Pf malaria. We reported that CHMI using the bites of 3 PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes reared aseptically in compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) was successful in 6 participants. Here, we report results from a subsequent CHMI study using 3 PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes reared aseptically to validate the initial clinical trial. We also compare results of safety, tolerability, and transmission dynamics in participants undergoing CHMI using 3 PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes reared aseptically to published studies of CHMI using 5 mosquitoes. Nineteen adults aged 18-40 years were bitten by 3 Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes infected with the chloroquine-sensitive NF54 strain of Pf. All 19 participants developed malaria (100%); 12 of 19 (63%) on Day 11. The mean pre-patent period was 258.3 hours (range 210.5-333.8). The geometric mean parasitemia at first diagnosis by microscopy was 9.5 parasites/ÂµL (range 2-44). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detected parasites an average of 79.8 hours (range 43.8-116.7) before microscopy. The mosquitoes had a geometric mean of 37,894 PfSPZ/mosquito (range 3,500-152,200). Exposure to the bites of 3 aseptically-raised, PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes is a safe, effective procedure for CHMI in malaria-naÃ¯ve adults. The aseptic model should be considered as a new standard for CHMI trials in non-endemic areas. Microscopy is the gold standard used for the diagnosis of Pf malaria after CHMI, but qPCR identifies parasites earlier. If qPCR continues to be shown to be highly specific, and can be made to be practical, rapid, and standardized, it should be considered as an alternative for diagnosis.",

"Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) provides temporary mechanical circulatory support in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock, allowing time for cardiac recovery. Levosimendan is a calcium sensitizer with inotropic and vasodilatory effects used in the treatment of severe heart failure. It does not increase myocardial oxygen consumption. Its maximum hemodynamic response is seen 24-48 h after stopping infusion, but its effects can persist for 7-9 d owing to active metabolites. We sought to investigate whether the use of levosimendan improves weaning outcomes in patients on VA-ECMO. Six consecutive patients with cardiogenic shock were placed on femorofemoral VA-ECMO support and received levosimendan 24 h before the planned weaning (group A). As control group (group B), we retrospectively reviewed the VA-ECMO implanted at our institution before the introduction of the levosimendan protocol. These patients received only traditional inotropes. The weaning rate was 83.33% in group A and 27.3% in group B. The survival rate was 66.66% and 36.4%, respectively. In group A, three of six patients (50%) required inotropic/vasopressor support after ECMO cessation, while in group B 11 of 11 patients (100%) required support. In our case series, pretreatment with levosimendan seems to facilitate weaning from VA-ECMO, reducing the need for high-dose inotropes.",

"Severe anaemia is a life-threatening complication of falciparum malaria associated with loss of predominantly non-parasitized red blood cells (npRBCs). This poorly elucidated process might be influenced by (i) rosettes, i.e. npRBCs cytoadherent to haemozoin-containing parasitized RBCs (pRBCs) and (ii) generation in pRBCs of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) through haemozoin-catalysed lipid peroxidation. We explored whether close proximity in rosettes may facilitate 4-HNE transfer to npRBCs, which is likely to enhance their phagocytosis and contribute to malaria anaemia. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry data indicated 4-HNE transfer to npRBCs in rosettes. Rosettes were formed by 64Â·8âÂ±â1Â·8% varO-expressing pRBCs, and 8Â·7âÂ±â1Â·1% npRBCs were positive for 4-HNE-protein-conjugates, while low-rosetting parasites generated only 2Â·4âÂ±â1Â·1% 4-HNE-conjugate-positive npRBCs. 4-HNE transfer decreased after blocking rosetting by monoclonal antibodies. A positive linear relationship between rosette frequency and 4-HNE-conjugates in npRBCs was found in 40 malaria patients, a first indication for a role of rosetting in npRBCs modifications in vivo. Children with severe malaria anaemia had significantly higher percentages of 4-HNE-conjugate-positive npRBCs compared to children with uncomplicated malaria. In conclusion, 4-HNE transfer from pRBCs to npRBCs in rosettes is suggested to play a role in the phagocytic removal of large numbers of npRBCs, the hallmark of severe malaria anaemia.",

"6,512 laparoscopic cholecystectomies have been performed by 141 surgeons. The lithiasis was uncomplicated in 80% of cases. Conversion from laparoscopy to laparotomy was necessary in 350 cases (5.37%), for technical problems (22 cases), complications (87 cases) or surgical difficulties (241 cases): 107 cholecystitis, 68 adhesions, 14 difficulties in finding the cystic duct and 25 common bile duct stones were the principle surgical difficulties. Among the 304 complications, we have observed 35 general and 251 local complications: 58 haemorrhages, 12 common bile duct lesions (10 cases of iatrogenic trauma and 2 accidental ligations), 4 cystic duct problems and 3 cases of intestinal trauma were the principle per-laparoscopic complications. Among the 164 post-laparoscopies cholecystectomy's complications, we have observed 50 biliary fistulae with 32 requiring further surgery (damage to the common bile duct in 14 cases), 3 common bile duct strictures, 20 haemorrhages (7 requiring further surgery), 31 deep or sub-phrenic abscesses (16 requiring further surgery) and 2 peritonitis after intestinal trauma. We have had 7 deaths (0.10%). Prognostic factors are: 1) The degree of surgeon's experience; the first 50 laparoscopies cholecystectomies performed are more likely to require further surgery (P < 0.05). 2) Cholecystitis with an significantly higher rate of conversion to laparotomy (P < 0.001) and morbidity (P < 0.01). For an experienced surgeon the biliary morbidity is near to that observed in classical cholecystectomy.",

"During blood stage infection, Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes (IE) bind to host blood vessels. This virulence determinant enables parasites to evade spleen-dependent killing mechanisms, but paradoxically in some cases may reduce parasite fitness by killing the host. Adhesion of infected erythrocytes is mediated by P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), a family of polymorphic adhesion proteins encoded by var genes. Whereas cerebral binding and severe malaria are associated with parasites expressing DC8 and DC13 var genes, relatively little is known about the non-brain endothelial selection on severe malaria adhesive types. In this study, we selected P. falciparum-IEs on diverse endothelial cell types and demonstrate that DC8 and DC13 var genes were consistently among the major var transcripts selected on non-brain endothelial cells (lung, heart, bone marrow). To investigate the molecular basis for this avid endothelial binding activity, recombinant proteins were expressed from the predominant upregulated DC8 transcript, IT4var19. In-depth binding comparisons revealed that multiple extracellular domains from this protein bound brain and non-brain endothelial cells, and individual domains largely did not discriminate between different endothelial cell types. Additionally, we found that recombinant DC8 and DC13 CIDR1 domains exhibited a widespread endothelial binding activity and could compete for DC8-IE binding to brain endothelial cells, suggesting they may bind the same host receptor. Our findings provide new insights into the interaction of severe malaria adhesive types and host blood vessels and support the hypothesis that parasites causing severe malaria express PfEMP1 variants with a superior ability to adhere to diverse endothelial cell types, and may therefore endow these parasites with a growth and transmission advantage.",
"Adrenomedullin is a novel hypotensive peptide, newly discovered in pheochromocytoma. Because immunoreactive adrenomedullin is present in human plasma, adrenomedullin may play a role in regulating blood pressure. A recent report showed that human adrenomedullin mRNA is expressed not only in pheochromocytoma but also in the normal adrenal medulla, kidney, lung, and ventricle. However, whether or not these organs actually release adrenomedullin into the circulation remains unknown. To investigate the sites of production and degradation of adrenomedullin in human subjects, we obtained blood samples from various sites and measured immunoreactive adrenomedullin concentrations. In study 1, blood samples were obtained from the infrarenal inferior vena cava, suprarenal inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillary, left ventricle, and aorta during cardiac catheterization in 15 patients with ischemic heart disease (67 +/- 10 years). In study 2, blood samples were taken from the infrarenal inferior vena cava, suprarenal inferior vena cava, right and left renal veins, and left adrenal vein in 5 hypertensive patients (42 +/- 14 years) suspected of having renovascular hypertension. In study 3, peripheral venous blood samples were obtained in 2 patients (males, 45 and 36 years old) with pheochromocytoma at rest and during hypertensive attacks. Plasma adrenomedullin concentrations were measured by a newly developed radioimmunoassay. In study 1, there were no significant differences in plasma adrenomedullin concentrations in various sites of the right-side circulation. There was no step-up of plasma adrenomedullin levels in the coronary sinus. However, the plasma concentration of adrenomedullin in aorta was slightly but significantly lower than in pulmonary artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

"Eleven patients completed the trial, contributing 99 patient-months of monitoring and providing 122 INR measures. The mean proportion of INR values in therapeutic range among subjects in the PSM and physician-management groups was 82% and 80%, respectively (P = .82). The improvement in patient satisfaction with PSM was not significant. Ten of the 11 patients preferred PSM to physician management and elected to continue with this strategy after study completion (P = .001). No calls or visits were made to the physician regarding dose adjustment during the PSM period. There were no episodes of major bleeding or thromboembolic events.",

"The clinical outcome of acute cardiovascular events may be more favorable in patients with a high body mass index (BMI), although obesity increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases. The authors sought to define the association between BMI and acute and long-term outcome of patients presenting within 12Â hours of ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a large multinational cohort. A total of 3,579 patients enrolled in the Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial were stratified according to BMI quartiles: <24.5, 24.5 to <27.1, 27.1 to 30.1, and >30.1Â kg/m(2) (quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). Death, myocardial reinfarction, ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization, stroke, and noncoronary artery bypass grafting-related major bleeding events were centrally adjudicated for the acute, 30Â days, and yearly follow-up. Patients with a BMI in the highest quartile were younger than patients in the lower BMI quartiles and more frequently had hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Complete occlusions and noncalcified lesions were more common in patients with a high BMI. In-hospital mortality decreased with increasing BMI due to lower cardiac mortality (2.9%, 2.3%, 1.2%, and 1.0% for quartiles 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, pÂ <0.05). Out-of-hospital 3-year mortality was also lower in higher-weight patients due to lower noncardiac mortality (4.2%, 2.6%, 2.3%, and 1.7% for quartiles 1 to 4, respectively, pÂ = 0.01). After adjustment for covariates, BMI was no longer predictive of acute or long-term mortality after STEMI. In conclusion, as BMI increases, patients have a more extensive adjusted cardiovascular risk profile and disease burden and premature STEMI onset but similar adjusted acute and long-term outcomes.",

"Elevated levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and phosphorus (P) have been linked to greater risks of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). The aim of this study was to test if differences exist in a long nocturnal HD group in comparison with a group treated with standard daily thrice weekly dialysis. The attempt was to evaluate if elevated FGF-23 levels, intact parathyroid hormone and P might be associated with left ventricular mass index (LVMI). Quantitative echocardiographic analyses were performed at baseline in 50 maintenance HD patients (17 women and 33 men, mean age: 56.4âÂ±â15.35 years, mean HD vintage: 9.06âÂ±â8.86 years, all patients are on HD thrice a week-median duration 15âh/week, 10 of them on long nocturnal HD, median duration 24âh/week). LVMIs were calculated. FGF23 was measured in duplicate using a second generation C-terminal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and log of FGF-23 values were computed. Mean LVMI was 136.44âÂ±â44.44âg/m(2) . Serum FGF-23 levels were elevated when compared to population data with preserved kidney function (median 1388.5âRU/mL, range 252 to 24â336âRU/mL). There were no correlations recorded between log FGF-23 levels and LVMI (râ=â0.2, Pâ=â0.66). LVMI was significantly lower in HD patients on long nocturnal dialysis procedure (râ=â-0.31, Pâ=â0.05). Patients treated with long nocturnal HD showed lower LV mass, lower P-values and higher 25-OH-D3 supply. Plasma FGF-23 concentration was comparable between the groups and was not associated with LVMI in our maintenance HD patients.",

"A follow-up study was conducted to determine the magnitude of and factors related to adherence to artemether/lumefantrine (ALu) treatment in rural settings in Tanzania. Children in five villages of Kilosa District treated at health facilities were followed-up at their homes on Day 7 after the first dose of ALu. For those found to be positive using a rapid diagnostic test for malaria and treated with ALu, their caretakers were interviewed on drug administration habits. In addition, capillary blood samples were collected on Day 7 to determine lumefantrine concentrations. The majority of children (392/444; 88.3%) were reported to have received all doses, in time. Non-adherence was due to untimeliness rather than missing doses and was highest for the last two doses. No significant difference was found between blood lumefantrine concentrations among adherent (median 286 nmol/l) and non-adherent [median 261 nmol/l; range 25 nmol/l (limit of quantification) to 9318 nmol/l]. Children from less poor households were more likely to adhere to therapy than the poor [odds ratio (OR)=2.45, 95% CI 1.35-4.45; adjusted OR=2.23, 95% CI 1.20-4.13]. The high reported rate of adherence to ALu in rural areas is encouraging and needs to be preserved to reduce the risk of emergence of resistant strains. The age-based dosage schedule and lack of adherence to ALu treatment guidelines by health facility staff may explain both the huge variability in observed lumefantrine concentrations and the lack of difference in concentrations between the two groups.",

"Baseline studies of 111Indium oxine labelled platelet life-span, platelet alpha-granule release products, beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG) and platelet factor 4 (PF4), and factor VIII related activities were performed on 9 asymptomatic patients with sickle cell disease, who were subsequently randomised in a prospective double-blind trial of ticlopidine (250 mg. b. d.) or placebo for one month and the investigations repeated. Control studies indicated that 5 of the 9 patients had shortened platelet survivals: mean beta TG (50.8 ng/ml) and PF4 (19.5 ng/ml), factor VIII:C (283.4 i.u./dl) and factor VIIIR:AG (168.7 u/dl) levels were raised. Ticlopidine treatment did not significantly improve platelet life-span or factor VIII levels, though it was associated with reduced values of beta TG and PF4. One patient taking ticlopidine developed an infarctive sickle crisis. Although ticlopidine blocked platelet activation, this alone did not improve platelet survival or prevent sickle crisis: in view of evidence of platelet activation in sickle cell disease, however, a longer trial of prophylactic antiplatelet drugs might be warranted.",
"Vernakalant hydrochloride is a novel, relatively atrial-selective antiarrhythmic agent that rapidly converts atrial fibrillation (AF) to sinus rhythm (SR). This analysis integrates pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety data from 5 clinical trials of patients with AF or atrial flutter (AFL). Patients were initially given a 10-min intravenous (IV) infusion of vernakalant 3 mg/kg or placebo. If SR was not evident after a 15-min observation, then a second 10-min IV infusion of vernakalant 2 mg/kg or placebo was given. Population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models were constructed for QT interval prolongation corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) and for changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP). The exposure-response relationships for QTcF and SBP were best described by sigmoidal maximum-effect (E (max)) models. For QTcF, the model was characterized by a typical E (max) of 20.3 ms, and by a vernakalant median effective concentration dependent (ECââ) on conversion status (4,222 ng/ml for patients converting to SR and 2,276 ng/ml for those remaining in AF/AFL). For SBP, the model was characterized by E (max) of 3.05 mmHg and ECââ of 1,141 ng/ml. Risk of hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg) was primarily associated with low baseline SBP and to a smaller extent with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF); plasma vernakalant concentrations showed a small contribution to the risk of hypotension (relative risk = 1.4 at 4,000 ng/ml), which may be significant with a baseline SBP of <105 mmHg. These results show that vernakalant had a smaller effect on QTcF in patients who demonstrated conversion to SR than those remaining in AF or AFL, and it had a relatively small effect on SBP.",

"The World Health Organization (WHO) recently issued revised first-line antituberculosis (anti-TB) drug dosage recommendations for children. No pharmacokinetic studies for these revised dosages are available for children <2 years. The aim of the study was to document the pharmacokinetics of the first-line anti-TB agents in children <2 years of age comparing previous and revised WHO dosages of isoniazid (INH; 5 versus 10 mg/kg/day), rifampin (RMP; 10 versus 15 mg/kg/day), and pyrazinamide (PZA; 25 versus 35 mg/kg/day) and to investigate the effects of clinical covariates, including HIV coinfection, nutritional status, age, gender, and type of tuberculosis (TB), and the effect of NAT2 acetylator status. Serum INH, PZA, and RMP levels were prospectively assessed in 20 children <2 years of age treated for TB following the previous and the revised WHO dosage recommendations. Samples were taken prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1.5, 3, and 5 h following dosing. The maximum drug concentration in serum (C(max)), the time to C(max) (t(max)), and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were calculated. Eleven children had pulmonary and 9 had extrapulmonary TB. Five were HIV infected. The mean C(max) (Î¼g/ml) following the administration of previous/revised dosages were as follows: INH, 3.19/8.11; RMP, 6.36/11.69; PZA, 29.94/47.11. The mean AUC (Î¼gÂ·h/ml) were as follows: INH, 8.09/20.36; RMP, 17.78/36.95; PZA, 118.0/175.2. The mean C(max) and AUC differed significantly between doses. There was no difference in the t(max) values achieved. Children less than 2 years of age achieve target concentrations of first-line anti-TB agents using revised WHO dosage recommendations. Our data provided supportive evidence for the implementation of the revised WHO guidelines for first-line anti-TB therapy in young children.",
"Vitamin A supplementation improves status, which may protect against malarial infection. Provitamin A carotenoid biofortified staple crops may provide a more sustainable approach to alleviate vitamin A deficiency than supplementation, but the impact of febrile illness on food intake must be considered in malaria endemic regions. Morbidity data and food logs from a three-month efficacy trial on provitamin A biofortified (orange) maize in preschool Zambian children (nâ=â181, age 3-5 years) were systematically analyzed over time to determine the impact of malaria on food intake. Nutrients examined included macronutrients, iron, zinc, and vitamin A. Comparisons based on individual intakes in healthy and malarial states over three-day intervals were made including children from both the orange and white maize groups (nâ=â100). Malaria prevalence did not differ overall or between treatment groups over time (all Pâ>â0.05). Lower nutrient intakes were observed for all variables during malaria outbreaks (food 289âÂ±â412âg; energy 248âÂ±â346âkcal; carbohydrate 42âÂ±â62âg; protein 8âÂ±â12âg; fat 5âÂ±â7âg; iron 1âÂ±â2âmg; zinc 1âÂ±â1âmg; vitamin A 58âÂ±â100 retinol activity equivalents; all Pâ<â0.05). No differences were observed between nutrient decreases in orange and white maize groups (Pâ>â0.05). Considering the impact of malaria on food and nutrient intakes and increased vitamin A utilization and excretion due to the acute phase response, biofortification targets for provitamin A carotenoids may need to be elevated in malaria endemic regions.",
"Conventional indirect drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with liquid medium is well established and offers time-saving and reliable results. This multicenter study was carried out to evaluate if drug susceptibility testing (DST) can be successfully carried out directly from processed smear-positive specimens (direct DST) and if this approach could offer substantial time savings. Sputum specimens were digested, decontaminated, and concentrated by the laboratory routine procedure and were inoculated in Bactec MGIT 960 as well as Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium for primary isolation. All the processed specimens which were acid-fast bacterium (AFB) smear positive were used for setting up direct DST for isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF). After the antimicrobial mixture of polymyxin B, amphotericin B, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, and azlocillin (PANTA) was added, the tubes were entered in the MGIT 960 instrument using the 21-day protocol (Bactec 960 pyrazinamide [PZA] protocol). Results obtained by direct DST were compared with those obtained by indirect DST to establish accuracy and time savings by this approach. Of a total of 360 AFB smear-positive sputum specimens set up for direct DST at four sites in three different countries, 307 (85%) specimens yielded reportable results. Average reporting time for direct DST was 11 days (range, 10 to 12 days). The average time savings by direct DST compared to indirect DST, which included time to isolate a culture and perform DST, was 8 days (range, 6 to 9 days). When results of direct DST were compared with those of indirect DST, there was 95.1% concordance with INH and 96.1% with rifampin. These findings indicate that direct DST with the Bactec MGIT 960 system offers further time savings and is a quick method to reliably detect multidrug resistance (MDR) cases.",

"Many cross-sectional studies show an inverse association between dietary magnesium and insulin resistance, but few longitudinal studies examine the ability to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for magnesium intake through food and its effect on insulin resistance among participants with metabolic syndrome (MetS). The dietary intervention study examined this question in 234 individuals with MetS. Magnesium intake was assessed using 24-h dietary recalls at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Fasting glucose and insulin levels were collected at each time point; and insulin resistance was estimated by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). The relation between magnesium intake and HOMA-IR was assessed using linear mixed models adjusted for covariates. Baseline magnesium intake was 287 Â± 93 mg/day (mean Â± standard deviation), and HOMA-IR, fasting glucose and fasting insulin were 3.7 Â± 3.5, 99 Â± 13 mg/dL, and 15 Â± 13 Î¼U/mL, respectively. At baseline, 6-, and 12-months, 23.5%, 30.4%, and 27.7% met the RDA for magnesium. After multivariate adjustment, magnesium intake was inversely associated with metabolic biomarkers of insulin resistance (P < 0.01). Further, the likelihood of elevated HOMA-IR (>3.6) over time was 71% lower [odds ratio (OR): 0.29; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12, 0.72] in participants in the highest quartile of magnesium intake than those in the lowest quartile. For individuals meeting the RDA for magnesium, the multivariate-adjusted OR for high HOMA-IR over time was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.77). These findings indicate that dietary magnesium intake is inadequate among non-diabetic individuals with MetS and suggest that increasing dietary magnesium to meet the RDA has a protective effect on insulin resistance.",

"The oxidant-antioxidant balance disorders underlie a number of acute and chronic diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). It is believed that oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. The study objective was to assess the processes of lipid peroxidation with malondialdehyde (MDA) as its major indicator and to determine the activities of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase (GSSG-R) in the serum and erythrocytes of patients at developmental age with migraine with and without aura. The study group consisted of 34 patients at the age of 10-18 years (mean +/- standard deviation: 14.04 +/- 2.29 years), suffering from migraine. The control group included 38 patients, aged 4-17 years (mean age 12.11 +/- 3.46). MDA concentration and activities of SOD, GSH-Px and GSSG-R were determined in serum and erythrocytes of all the patients. In the migraine group, the MDA levels in serum and erythrocytes were statistically significantly lower than in control subjects (p < 0.001). In the migraine group, serum GSH-Px activity was significantly higher (p < 0.05). The GSSG-R activity in the erythrocytes of migraine children was significantly higher compared to controls (p < 0.001). SOD activity was decreased and GSH-Px was increased (non-significantly) in erythrocytes of migraineurs. Our results confirm the disturbances of lipid peroxidation processes in migraine and suggest the activation of antioxidant mechanisms. Its important indicator seems to be the increase in the GSSG-R activity in the erythrocytes and the GSH-Px activity in serum between migraine attacks. Further studies are necessary.",

"Clinical factors such as tall stature, lean body mass, obstructive sleep apnea, alcohol or caffeine, smoking, endurance sports, and genetic factors are proposed as risk factors for lone atrial fibrillation (LAF). The KORAF (KORean Atrial Fibrillation) study is a retrospective multicenter registry that enrolled 3,570 consecutive atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Data on risk factors were available for 2,133 patients, of whom 398 (18.7%) were identified as having LAF. In univariate analysis, patients with LAF were more likely to be men (82.4% vs 59.8%, P < 0.001) and current smokers (25.9% vs 15.6%, P < 0.01), alcohol drinkers (55.3% vs 31.2%, P < 0.01) and frequent consumers of caffeinated beverages (> 2 cups/day) (31.7% vs 19.3%, P < 0.01), and have a family history of AF (9.0% vs 2.6%, P < 0.001) than the non-LAF patients. Multivariate analysis showed that male gender (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.61-3.27, P < 0.01), family history of AF (OR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.91-5.12, P < 0.01), current alcohol use (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.46-2.76, P < 0.01), and frequent caffeinated beverage consumption (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.20-2.29, P < 0.01) were independently associated with LAF.

"We compared the ocular hypotensive effect for 24 hours and the tolerability of latanoprost stored at 4 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Seventeen healthy volunteers were included in this crossover trial. Latanoprost 0.005% (Xalatan) was stored at 4 degrees C or 30 degrees C for 4 weeks in the dark. The subjects enrolled to the study were randomly assigned to receive either latanoprost stored at 4 degrees C or that stored at 30 degrees C. The eye drop was applied to the right eye of each subject for 3 days. The left eye served as a control without administration. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy and circadian intra ocular pressure (IOP) curve was performed at Day 3, every 3 hours from 6 pm. This procedure was repeated 7 days after changing the drug from 4 degrees C to 30 degrees C or vice versa, and application to the left eye for 3 days. Eyes treated with latanoprost, stored both at 4 degrees C and 30 degrees C, achieved statistically significantly lower mean IOPs than untreated eyes at all time points, except at 21 hours treated by the drug stored at 30 degrees C. We subtracted the IOP of eyes receiving latanoprost from the IOP of untreated eyes for each time point to evaluate the efficacy of the eye drops (delta IOP). There were no statistically significant differences between the delta IOPs with the drug stored at 4 degrees C and 30 degrees C. During the study, no subject developed a serious adverse event. These results suggest that latanoprost stored at 30 degrees C for 4 weeks after opening the bottle remains as effective and safe as latanoprost stored under cold conditions.",

"Tritiated yohimbine binding was used to estimate platelet membrane alpha 2-adrenoceptor characteristics in normal subjects (n = 12) and patients with essential hypertension (n = 30), primary hyperaldosteronism (n = 10) and phaeochromocytoma (n = 10). There was a 20-fold increase in mean levels of resting norepinephrine and epinephrine in the phaeochromocytoma group. Total binding sites (Bmax) and dissociation constant (Kd) for 3H-yohimbine did not differ significantly among the four groups. Following curative surgery for phaeochromocytoma, plasma catecholamine levels were normalized but the Bmax remained unchanged. Following surgery for primary hyperaldosteronism, levels of plasma norepinephrine rose but Bmax was not changed. In all but the phaeochromocytoma patients, Bmax values correlated positively (r = 0.437, n = 48, P less than 0.01) with resting plasma norepinephrine. A significant negative correlation was observed between the change in plasma norepinephrine in response to postural change and resting Bmax. Treatment for 2-4 weeks with guanabenz or bethanidine induced a parallel fall in both Bmax and plasma norepinephrine. Treatment with reserpine was followed by a comparable fall in plasma norepinephrine, but Bmax values were unchanged. The findings support the view that platelet alpha 2-adrenoceptor density is functionally regulated in parallel with sympathetic nerve activity rather than circulating catecholamine levels, although it is not known which neuronal substance(s) may participate in this regulation.",

"Diltiazem increases systemic exposure to simvastatin via inhibition of CYP3A. This study assessed the impact of this interaction on the lipid-lowering effects of simvastatin. Chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomized to receive simvastatin 20 mg daily alone or together with diltiazem 60 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks with a washout period of 4 weeks in an open-label, crossover study. Blood pressure, fasting serum lipid profile, and safety tests were determined at baseline and after each treatment period. Trough serum diltiazem was measured at the end of the 4-week combination treatment. In the 30 patients who completed the study, simvastatin treatment significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by mean (Â± standard error) 41.0% Â± 2.2% (P < .001), and the combination with diltiazem showed an additional reduction of 1.66% (95% confidence interval: -4.63 to 7.96, P > .05).

"This study compares the clinical effectiveness of somatic and ear acupuncture for treatment of migraine without aura. 35 patients were divided into 2 groups, one receiving somatic and the other ear acupuncture. Both groups were treated once a week for 8 weeks and needles were stimulated manually. The severity of pain was evaluated with the Migraine Index and the visual analogue of Scott-Huskisson; other 2 tests were used to monitor the pain threshold and Zung's Self-rating Depression Scale was applied to assess variations in patients' mood. These tests were performed before the beginning and at the end of treatment and, for the follow up, after 1, 3 and 6 months from the end of therapy. On the basis of the migraine index, pain at the end of therapy was significantly lower than before the treatment, being residual pain 54.83% and 63.43%, respectively for somatic and ear acupuncture. Apparently, the 2 treatments were equally effective, as no significant difference could be assessed. On the contrary, a significant difference between the 2 groups was clear during the follow up: in fact, after 6 months residual pain was 16.80% and 48.83% for somatic and ear acupuncture, respectively (p=0.038). These results were confirmed by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) test and by the evaluation of pain threshold. It is noteworthy that also Zung's depression test showed a significant decrease of score was present in both groups, at all the times investigated with no difference between the two treatments. These results, though preliminary, are quite promising in supporting the effectiveness of ear acupuncture for treatment of migraine without aura.",

"A 4-month regimen of gatifloxacin with rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide is being evaluated for the treatment of tuberculosis in a phase 3 randomized controlled trial (OFLOTUB). A prior single-dose study found that gatifloxacin exposure increased by 14% in the combination. The aims of the study are to evaluate the initial and steady-state pharmacokinetics of gatifloxacin when daily doses are given to patients with newly diagnosed drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis as part of a combination regimen and to evaluate the gatifloxacin dose with respect to the probability of attaining a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target. We describe the population pharmacokinetics of gatifloxacin from the first dose to a median of 28 days in 169 adults enrolled in the OFLOTUB trial in Benin, Guinea, Senegal, and South Africa. The probability of achieving a ratio of â¥125 for the area under the concentration time curve to infinity (AUC0-â) for the free fraction of gatifloxacin over the MIC (fAUC/MIC) was investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. The median AUC0-â of 41.2 Î¼g Â· h/ml decreased on average by 14.3% (90% confidence interval [CI], -90.5% to +61.5%) following multiple 400-mg daily doses. At steady state, 90% of patients achieved an fAUC/MIC of â¥125 only when the MIC was <0.125 Î¼g/ml. We conclude that systemic exposure to gatifloxacin declines with repeated daily 400-mg doses when used together with rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide, thus compensating for any initial increase in gatifloxacin levels due to a drug interaction. (The OFLOTUB study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. NCT00216385.).",
"Investigated group consisted of 28 patients (21 female and 7 male) with pheochromocytoma in mean age of 39.9 +/- 13 years, while control group comprised 25 healthy volunteers in mean age 36.0 +/- 7.2 years.

Plasma fibrinogen and beta-thromboglobulin were increased in pheochromocytoma before surgery after pharmacological treatment and also after excision of the tumor. Whereas altered erythrocyte deformability before any treatment, only. Plasma neuropeptide Y concentration was higher in pheochromocytoma before surgery and after pharmacological treatment. There was no correlation between plasma catecholamines, plasma fibrinogen, beta-thromboglobulin, and erythrocyte deformability. Our results suggest that rheological abnormalities observed in patients with pheochromocytoma may contribute to vascular complications in this subjects. Sympathetic nervous system seems to influence indirectly observed rheological abnormalities.",

"In a double-blinded study we examined the effect of supplementing patient-controlled morphine analgesia with intercostal nerve blockade to identify if this improved analgesia and reduced morphine requirements following renal transplantation. Fifty patients were randomized to receive unilateral intercostal nerve block with either 0.5% bupivacaine or saline to the lower five intercostal nerves. Each block was performed on the side of surgical incision following the completion of surgery. Patients receiving bupivacaine blockade reported reduced pain scores and used less morphine in the initial 4 h following renal transplantation, but did not demonstrate a significant reduction in overall pain scores, total 24 h morphine requirements, or sedation scores. Two patients developed a pneumothorax, neither of which were clinically apparent at the time of diagnosis, and only detected by chest radiography.

"Some patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have a poor prognosis due to left ventricular remodeling (LVR), resulting in the recurrence of congestive heart failure even when therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) has been initiated. We investigated the effect of early administration of the direct renin inhibitor (DRI) aliskiren in combination with an ACEI or an ARB on LVR using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in patients with AMI.Twenty-one consecutive patients were treated with an ACEI or an ARB (non-DRI group), and another 21 consecutive patients received aliskiren 150 mg/day combined with an ACEI or an ARB (DRI group). CMR imaging was performed 7 days after AMI and 10 months later.CMR imaging revealed no significant changes in LV end-systolic volume, LV end-diastolic volume, or LV ejection fraction between the patients with and without DRI aliskiren. In the DRI group, plasma renin activity was significantly lower in both the acute and chronic phases; however, aldosterone levels were significantly lower in the acute but not the chronic phase.A low dose of aliskiren may be insufficient to maintain suppression of aldosterone under current standard therapies with an ACEI or an ARB and Î²-blocker in patients with primary AMI, and results in no attenuation of LVR.",

"The treatment of calcified coronary lesions by percutaneous coronary intervention has been shown to be associated with poor outcomes and an increased rate of complications. However, the impact of coronary calcification in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is unknown. A total of 755 patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome in the Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy trial underwent CABG. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the presence and extent of coronary calcifications (lesion level: severe, moderate, none to mild) as assessed by an independent angiographic core laboratory. Major ischemic and bleeding outcomes were assessed at 30Â days and 1Â year. Severe calcification was found in 103 patients (13.6%), moderate calcification in 249 patients (33.0%), and none-to-mild calcification in 403 patients (53.4%). The presence of severe calcification compared with moderate or none to mild was associated with a significantly higher unadjusted rate of death (11.8% vs 3.7% vs 4.5%, pÂ = 0.006), death or myocardial infarction (MI; 31.1% vs 19.7% vs 16.4%, pÂ = 0.006), and major adverse cardiac event (MACE; 32.0% vs 22.6% vs 20.8%, pÂ = 0.059) at 1Â year.

In conclusion, the presence of severe coronary calcification was associated with worse outcomes after CABG, including an increased risk of death. The presence of severe coronary calcification was identified as an independent predictor of MACE and death or MI 1Â year after CABG.",

"The alphaIIbbeta3 antagonist eptifibatide is an effective treatment for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Platelet reactivity and CD40 ligand (CD40L) may play a role in the pathophysiology of sickle cell anaemia (SCA) similar to that in ACS, suggesting that inhibition of platelet aggregation and CD40L release by eptifibatide may benefit patients with SCA. Following eptifibatide infusion, safety and pharmacodynamic data were obtained from four SCA patients in their non-crisis, steady states. Eptifibatide was well tolerated, with no adverse changes in the haematological, biochemical or coagulation parameters studied. Eptifibatide did not increase plasma levels of platelet factor 4 or beta-thromboglobulin, P-selectin exposure or platelet:leucocyte aggregate formation. Moreover, decreases in platelet aggregation and soluble CD40L (sCD40L) levels achieved in SCA patients were comparable to those observed in the treatment of ACS. Finally, indicators of inflammation, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and myoglobin were reduced following eptifibatide infusion, while vasodilation correlatives, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and leptin were increased. Based on these phase I results, eptifibatide may benefit SCA patients by inhibiting platelet aggregation, decreasing sCD40L levels and favourably altering plasma levels of inflammatory mediators.",

"Diabetic older adults are at a higher risk of muscle strength (MS) decline than their non-diabetic counterparts. Adequate protein and energy intakes and physical activity (PA) may preserve MS during aging. However, the role of diet quality (DQ) in MS maintenance is still unknown. This study aimed to determine the association between DQ - alone or combined with PA - and changes in MS over 3 years in diabetic participants aged 67 to 84 years at recruitment in a secondary analysis of the longitudinal observational NuAge study. Changes in handgrip, knee extensor and elbow flexor strengths were calculated as the difference between recruitment (T1) and after 3 years (T4) in 156 diabetic older adults. Baseline DQ was calculated from 3 non-consecutive 24-hour dietary recalls collected at T1 using the validated Canadian Healthy Eating Index (C-HEI). Change in PA was calculated from Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) as PASE T4-PASE T1. Four combinations of variables were created: C-HEI<70 with PASE change either < or > median and C-HEI â¥ 70 with PASE change either < or > median. The association between these four categories and MS maintenance was evaluated using General Linear Modeling (GLM). Analyses were stratified by sex and controlled for covariates. Baseline DQ alone was not associated with MS maintenance. Baseline DQ combined with PASE change showed associations with crude and baseline adjusted handgrip strength (p=0.031, p=0.018) and crude and baseline adjusted elbow flexor change (p=0.028, p=0.017) in males only; no significant results were found for knee extensor strength in either males or females. While findings for females were inconclusive, results demonstrate that better adherence to dietary guidelines combined with a more active lifestyle may prevent MS decline among diabetic older males. Additional research is needed on a larger sample since generalization of these results is limited by the small sample size.",

"GISSI-HF was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing n-3 PUFA and rosuvastatin vs. corresponding placebos in patients with chronic HF. Atrial fibrillation occurrence was defined as the presence of AF in the electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at each visit during the trial or AF as a cause of worsening HF or hospital admission or as an event during hospitalization. Among the 3690 patients (80.7%) without AF on their baseline ECG, 15.0% developed AF during a median follow-up period of 3.7 years, 258 randomized to rosuvastatin (13.9%) vs. 294 allocated to placebo (16.0%). Although the difference was not significant at unadjusted analysis (P = 0.097) and multivariable analysis adjusting for clinical variables (P = 0.067), it became significant after adjustment for clinical variables and laboratory examinations (P = 0.039), and for clinical variables, laboratory examinations, and background therapies (P = 0.038).",
"Erythropoietin (EPO) was hypothesized to mitigate reperfusion injury, in part via mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). The REVEAL trial found no reduction in infarct size with a single dose of EPO (60,000 U) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. In a substudy, we aimed to determine the feasibility of cryopreserving and centrally analyzing EPC levels to assess the relationship between EPC numbers, EPO administration, and infarct size. As a prespecified substudy, mononuclear cells were locally cryopreserved before as well as 24 and 48-72 h after primary percutaneous coronary intervention. EPC samples were collected in 163 of 222 enrolled patients. At least one sample was obtained from 125 patients, and all three time points were available in 83 patients. There were no significant differences in the absolute EPC numbers over time or between EPO- and placebo-treated patients; however, there was a trend toward a greater increase in EPC levels from 24 to 48-72 h postintervention in patients receiving â¥30,000 U of EPO (P = 0.099 for CD133(+) cells, 0.049 for CD34(+) cells, 0.099 for ALDH(br) cells). EPC numbers at baseline were inversely related to infarct size (P = 0.03 for CD133(+) cells, 0.006 for CD34(+) cells). Local whole cell cryopreservation and central EPC analysis in the context of a multicenter randomized trial is feasible but challenging. High-dose (â¥30,000 U) EPO may mobilize EPCs at 48-72 h, and baseline EPC levels may be inversely associated with infarct size.",

"A total of 346 infants aged less than 72 hours were randomly allocated to be treated either by high frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV; rate fixed at 60/minute throughout treatment and initial inspiratory:expiratory (I:E) ratio 1:2, increased to 1:1 if necessary) or by low frequency positive pressure ventilation (LFPPV; rate less than or equal to 40/minute and initial I:E ratio usually 1:1, both decreasing during weaning). The main hypotheses were that HFPPV reduces pneumothorax, chronic lung disease and death before discharge in all infants, as well as those with hyaline membrane disease, and that it reduces the incidence of later neurodevelopmental complications in infants of less than 33 weeks' gestation. Among all the infants the rate of pneumothorax was 19% in the HFPPV group and 26% in the LFPPV group (p = 0.13; odds ratio 0.7, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.4 to 1.1); there was no difference in mortality or the incidence of chronic lung disease. In infants of less than 33 weeks' gestation there were no differences in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Among the subgroup of 237 infants with hyaline membrane disease, median fractional inspired oxygen at the time of entry to the trial was 0.6 in the HFPPV group and 0.7 in the LFPPV group, indicating that many had moderately severe disease. In patients with hyaline membrane disease HFPPV was associated with a lower rate of pneumothorax (18% in the HFPPV group compared with 33% in the LFPPV group, p = 0.013, odds ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.8, with no differences in mortality, or in duration of intubation or supplementary oxygen in survivors. As used in this study, HFPPV was the preferred ventilator regimen for infants with hyaline membrane disease.",

"The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of allodynia on treatment outcomes in the patients with acute migraine treated in the "Act when Mild" (AwM) study. AwM, a randomized placebo-controlled trial, studied almotriptan 12.5 mg in the early treatment (within 1 hr) of acute migraine when the pain was still mild, and investigated clinical outcomes in the presence or absence of allodynia, which was prospectively recorded using patient questionnaires. Of the total population, 39% (n = 404) reported allodynia that did not alter the efficacy of almotriptan administered for early/mild pain in terms of 2-hr pain-free rates (53.9% for allodynic patients vs. 52.5% for nonallodynic patients). Similarly, sustained pain-free rates were 47.2% versus 45.5%, and migraine duration 1.40 versus 1.54 hr, respectively. However, allodynia impaired the effectiveness of almotriptan in the patients with moderate/severe pain in terms of longer migraine duration, fewer patients achieving pain-free status, and more requiring rescue medication. In conclusion, the lack of effect of allodynia on the efficacy of almotriptan given for early/mild migraine pain might help explain the improved outcomes associated with the early-treatment strategy in AwM. Moreover, the data suggest that pain intensity is the main driver of triptan response, and not the presence or absence of allodynia.",
"At a median of 3.6 years of follow-up, major vascular events had occurred in 832 patients receiving clopidogrel (6.8% per year) and in 924 patients receiving placebo (7.6% per year) (relative risk with clopidogrel, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 0.98; P=0.01). The difference was primarily due to a reduction in the rate of stroke with clopidogrel. Stroke occurred in 296 patients receiving clopidogrel (2.4% per year) and 408 patients receiving placebo (3.3% per year) (relative risk, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.83; P<0.001). Myocardial infarction occurred in 90 patients receiving clopidogrel (0.7% per year) and in 115 receiving placebo (0.9% per year) (relative risk, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.03; P=0.08). Major bleeding occurred in 251 patients receiving clopidogrel (2.0% per year) and in 162 patients receiving placebo (1.3% per year) (relative risk, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.92; P<0.001).",

"Bivalirudin, as compared with the control intervention, reduced the risk of the primary outcome (5.1% vs. 8.5%; relative risk, 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.82; P=0.001) and the principal secondary outcome (6.6% vs. 9.2%; relative risk, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96; P=0.02). Bivalirudin also reduced the risk of major bleeding (2.6% vs. 6.0%; relative risk, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.66; P<0.001). The risk of acute stent thrombosis was higher with bivalirudin (1.1% vs. 0.2%; relative risk, 6.11; 95% CI, 1.37 to 27.24; P=0.007).

"The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of an antibiotic regimen on the incidence of empyema in patients admitted with isolated chest trauma (ISS 9/10) and hemopneumothorax requiring tube thoracostomy. All patients with isolated chest trauma and hemopneumothorax (estimated ISS 9 or 10) seen in our trauma center were considered eligible for this study. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: age less than 18 years, presence of shock at the time of initial resuscitation, ongoing antibiotic therapy for unrelated disease, documented pre-existing infection or documented abnormal immune status. Ninety patients were randomized to two treatment limbs: antibiotics and tube thoracostomy or tube thoracostomy alone. All patients had the procedure performed in the trauma center in a standard fashion. Wound care and tube care were identical. Antibiotic therapy consisted of a first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin), one dose given just before the procedure and then q 6 h into the tube removal. Injury Severity Scores were established as described by Schwab after the manner of Baker. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test of binary outcome. In this study, antibiotics were able to reduce the incidence of empyema in patients with isolated chest trauma and for such patients antibiotic treatment appears justified. Further work is required to determine the effect on patients with more severe injury and multisystem involvement.",
"Of the patients, 27% were female (age 72.1 Â± 12.6 years) and 73% were male (64.2 Â± 12.9 years). 46.8% had comorbidities and they were less likely to receive guideline-recommended drug therapy and reperfusion. Heart failure (adjusted OR 1.88; 95% CI 1.57 to 2.25), metastatic tumours (OR 2.25; 95% CI 1.60 to 3.19), renal diseases (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.60 to 2.11) and diabetes (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.19 to 1.54) were strong predictors of in-hospital mortality. In this population, CCI weighted the history of prior myocardial infarction higher (1 instead of -0.4, 95% CI -1.2 to 0.3 points) but heart failure (1 instead of 3.7, 95% CI 2.6 to 4.7) and renal disease (2 instead of 3.5, 95% CI 2.7 to 4.4) lower than the benchmark, where all comorbidities, age and gender were used as predictors. However, the model with CCI and age has an identical discrimination to this benchmark (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were both 0.76).",

"A sensitive biomarker of malaria infection would obviate the need for placebo control arms in clinical trials of malaria prophylactic drugs. Antibodies to the 42-kDa fragment of merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1(42)) have been identified as a potential marker of malaria exposure in individuals receiving prophylaxis with mefloquine. We conducted an open-label trial to determine the sensitivity of seroconversion to MSP1(42), defined as a fourfold rise in enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) titer, among 23 malaria naÃ¯ve volunteers receiving mefloquine prophylaxis and 6 controls after Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite challenge. All members of the control cohort but none of the mefloquine cohort developed patent parasitemia. Four of six controls but zero of the mefloquine cohort seroconverted to MSP1(42). We conclude that malaria infection during suppressive prophylaxis does not induce antibody response to the blood-stage antigen MSP1(42) in a malaria-naÃ¯ve study population.",

"The failure rate and complications following thoracic and lumbar paravertebral blocks performed in 620 adults and 42 children were recorded. The technique failure rate in adults was 6.1%. No failures occurred in children. The complications recorded were: inadvertent vascular puncture (6.8%); hypotension (4.0%); haematoma (2.4%); pain at site of skin puncture (1.3%); signs of epidural or intrathecal spread (1.0%); pleural puncture (0.8%); pneumothorax (0.5%). No complications were noted in the children. The use of a bilateral paravertebral technique was found approximately to double the likelihood of inadvertent vascular puncture (9% vs. 5%) and to cause an eight-fold increase in pleural puncture and pneumothorax (3% vs. 0.4%), when compared with unilateral blocks. The incidence of other complications was similar between bilateral and unilateral blocks.",
"The dosage of urinary catecholamines and their metabolites is a main element of diagnosis in the research of a pheochromocytoma in patients with high blood pressure. The literature reports high values of these compounds in patients treated with labetalol (an alpha/beta-blocker). An analytical interference has been evoked to explain these misleading results, which have not been observed with other beta-blockers. The goal of this work was to look for this eventual analytical interference in the dosage of urinary metanephrine by reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection, in patients with high blood pressure. Eighteen hypertensive patients, 52 +/- 14 years old, were included in the study. In 8 patients, a dosage of metanephrine, normetanephrine and creatinine on a 24 hours urine sample was performed before (D1) and 24 hours after (D3) the prescription of labetalol (200 mg twice a day). In the other group, labetalol was not prescribed but dosage was made in the same conditions. Urinary excretion of these compounds (metanephrine+normetanephrine) divided by urinary creatinine was not modified in the treated group (0.16 +/- 0.08 vs 0.14 +/- 0.04), nor in the reference group (0.17 +/- 0.08 vs 0.17 +/- 0.08). This study shows that administration of labetalol in patients with essential hypertension does not interfere with urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine determination after 48 hours of treatment. This implies that research for a pheochromocytoma is possible in patients with hypertension and receiving labetalol, by using reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with an electrochemical detector for the dosage of urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine.",
"Pulmonary lesions from active tuberculosis patients are thought to contain persistent, nonreplicating bacilli that arise from hypoxic stress. Metronidazole, approved for anaerobic infections, has antituberculosis activity against anoxic bacilli in vitro and in some animal models and may target persistent, nonreplicating bacilli. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis subjects were randomly assigned to receive metronidazole (500 mg thrice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks in addition to an individualized background regimen. Outcomes were measured radiologically (change on high-resolution computed tomography [HRCT]), microbiologically (time to sputum smear and culture conversion), and clinically (status 6 months after stopping therapy). Enrollment was stopped early due to excessive peripheral neuropathies in the metronidazole arm. Among 35 randomized subjects, 31 (15 metronidazole, 16 placebo) were included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis. There were no significant differences by arm in improvement of HRCT lesions from baseline to 2 or 6 months. More subjects in the metronidazole arm converted their sputum smear (P = 0.04) and liquid culture (P = 0.04) to negative at 1 month, but these differences were lost by 2 months. Overall, 81% showed clinical success 6 months after stopping therapy, with no differences by arm. However, 8/16 (50%) of subjects in the metronidazole group and 2/17 (12%) of those in the placebo group developed peripheral neuropathy. Subjects who received metronidazole were 4.3-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 17.1) more likely to develop peripheral neuropathies than subjects who received placebo. Metronidazole may have increased early sputum smear and culture conversion but was too neurotoxic to use over the longer term. Newer nitroimidazoles with both aerobic and anaerobic activity, now in clinical trials, may increase the sterilizing potency of future treatment regimens.",
"Insulinomas and phaeochromocytomas are neuroendocrine tumours that may be either sporadic or manifestation of a familial cancer syndromes and are both derived from the neural crest. In the present study, gene components of different signalling pathways were investigated in sporadic human insulinomas and phaeochromocytomas to identify the responsible candidates. Ret and k-ras were tested for activating point mutations, and NF1, p53, BRCA1, nm23-H1, SDHB and SDHD for loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Twenty-two sporadic insulinomas and 15 phaeochromocytomas were analysed by the polymerase chain reaction using restriction fragment length polymorphism or dinucleotide repeat polymorphism methods. The results of our analysis demonstrate that the most frequent changes were point mutations of k-ras: 23% of insulinomas and 62% of phaeochromocytomas harboured k-ras mutations. The analysis also showed two phaeochromocytomas with point mutations of the ret oncogene. Only one insulinoma showed LOH of NF1, and another showed LOH of p53. Allelic loss of BRCA1 was detected in two insulinomas, and of nm23-H1 in another insulinoma. Allelic losses of the SDHB gene were present in two phaeochromocytoma and one insulinoma cases and allelic losses of SDHD were present in one phaeochromocytoma case. The changes observed in phaeochromocytomas were more homogenous and confined to k-ras and ret oncogenes, whereas insulinomas showed more heterogenic situation. Our findings may contribute to a better understanding of the genetic profile of neuroendocrine tumours.",

"Despite recommended preoperative preparation with alpha-adrenergic blockers, severe hemodynamic instability may occur during operations to resect pheochromocytoma. We combined the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor metyrosine in an attempt to better manage the hypertension of patients with pheochromocytoma undergoing surgical resection. This report reviews the cases of 25 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for known intra-abdominal pheochromocytoma. Each patient had elevated serum or urine levels of catecholamines or their metabolites. Nineteen patients were prepared before operation with phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine and six patients were given phenoxybenzamine alone. There were no significant differences in maximum, minimum, or mean blood pressure before or after tumor resection between patients who received metyrosine and those who did not. However careful review suggested that those who received metyrosine had more severe disease as judged by biochemical criteria. Study of selected patients matched for age and severity of disease suggested that the intraoperative blood pressure management of patients prepared with phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine was facilitated. In addition metyrosine-prepared patients lost less blood and required less volume replacement during surgery than did non-metyrosine-prepared patients. There were no apparent differences in postoperative fluid requirements. Although the study is not a prospective randomized trial, a retrospective review of patients managed with the combination of phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine suggests that surgery to resect pheochromocytoma can be better performed with both drugs than with phenoxybenzamine alone. The combination regimen appears to result in better blood pressure control, less blood loss, and the need for less intraoperative fluid replacement than does the traditional method of single-agent alpha-adrenergic blockade.",
"Forty-two subjects received placebo and 88 received lasmiditan in doses of 2.5-45 mg. Subjects were observed in the clinic for 4 h after treatment and used a diary card to record symptoms and adverse events for up to 24 h. The study was terminated when the 20 mg dose met predefined efficacy stopping rules. Of subjects treated in the 10, 20, 30 and 45 mg lasmiditan dose groups, 54-75% showed a 2 h headache response, compared to 45% in the placebo group (P = 0.0126 for the linear association between response rates and dose levels). Patient global impression at 2 h and lack of need for rescue medication also showed statistically significant linear correlations with dose. Lasmiditan was generally well tolerated. Adverse events were reported by 65% of subjects on lasmiditan and by 43% on placebo and were generally mild. Dizziness, paresthesia and sensations of heaviness (usually limb) were more common on lasmiditan.",
"Red blood cells (RBC) and reticulocyte parameters were determined on peripheral blood from a subset of patients enrolled in the multicenter study of hydroxyuea (HU) in sickle cell anemia. Multiple blood samples were obtained every 2 weeks. Cellular indices were measured by flow cytometry. Generalized linear models were used to determine the relationship between the longitudinal trajectories of RBC and reticulocyte indices and HU usage. There was a significant relationship between HU usage and most of the RBC and reticulocyte indices. Hydroxyurea produced higher value trajectories than those generated by placebo usage for the hemoglobin (Hb) content of both the RBCs and reticulocytes and for the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of reticulocytes. These changes were first detected 10 weeks after starting HU and before the increase in Hb F levels. The data suggest that subtle and early markers of response to HU reside in the hemogram.",

"Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) presenting in the neonatal period may resolve by 1 year of age. Predicting which patients require therapy beyond 1 year of age is desirable. Pediatric electrophysiology databases from two institutions were reviewed for patients with a history of infant SVT who underwent transesophageal electrophysiology study (TEEPS) after initial SVT and before 2 years of age. All patients were tested off medications and followed for clinical recurrence. Forty-two patients presented with SVT at median age of 4 days (0-300 days). Initial control was achieved with one drug in 31 patients and multiple drugs in 11 patients. Prior to TEEPS, nine patients had clinical recurrence in the first year of life after initial control had been previously achieved. For all patients, TEEPS was performed, without complications, at median 13 months (9-22 months) of age and at median of 13 months (6-22 months) following the initial SVT episode. SVT was inducible in 27/42: 8 atrio-ventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) and 19 atrio-ventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). Inducibility was not associated with age at presentation, age at TEEPS, ventricular dysfunction at presentation, presence of structural congenital heart disease, number of drugs required to initially control SVT, or SVT recurrence after initial control. Of 15 not inducible at TEEPS, none had known SVT recurrence off medications at median follow-up of 27 months (6-37 months). In conclusion, among patients having SVT in early infancy, (1) TEEPS results are not associated with clinical variables, (2) non-inducibility is a good indicator of lack of clinical recurrence at intermediate follow-up, and (3) AVNRT may be more prevalent in infancy than previously reported.",

"A role for the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) receptor in pulmonary innate immune responses has recently been explored. In the present study, we investigated the role that NOD2 plays in human alveolar macrophage innate responses and determined its involvement in the response to infection with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our results showed that NOD2 was expressed in human alveolar macrophages, and significant amounts of IL-1Î², IL-6, and TNF-Î± were produced upon ligand recognition with muramyldipeptide (MDP). NOD2 ligation induced the transcription and protein expression of the antimicrobial peptide LL37 and the autophagy enzyme IRGM in alveolar macrophages, demonstrating a novel function for this receptor in these cells. MDP treatment of alveolar macrophages improved the intracellular growth control of virulent M. tuberculosis; this was associated with a significant release of TNF-Î± and IL-6 and overexpression of bactericidal LL37. In addition, the autophagy proteins IRGM, LC3 and ATG16L1 were recruited to the bacteria-containing autophagosome after treatment with MDP. In conclusion, our results suggest that NOD2 can modulate the innate immune response of alveolar macrophages and play a role in the initial control of respiratory M. tuberculosis infections.",
"In a recent randomized controlled trial, the use of protease inhibitor (PI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) was associated with a significantly lower incidence of malaria compared with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based ART in a cohort of human immunodeficiency virus-infected Ugandan children living in an area of high malaria transmission intensity. In this report, we compared the prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia and gametocytemia using data from the same cohort. The prevalence of asymptomatic parasitemia did not differ between the two ART treatment arms. The PI-based arm was associated with a lower risk of gametocytemia at the time of diagnosis of malaria (6.6% versus 14.5%, P = 0.03) and during the 28 days after malaria diagnosis (3.4% versus 6.5%, P = 0.04). Thus, in addition to decreasing the incidence of malaria, the use of PI-based ART may lower transmission, as a result of a decrease in gametocytemia, in areas of high malaria transmission intensity.",

"Acquisition of non-sterilizing natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria has been shown in low transmission areas following multiple exposures. However, conflicting data from endemic areas suggest that the parasite may interfere with the induction of effective B-cell responses. To date, the impact of blood-stage parasite exposure on antigen-specific B cells has not been reported following controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Here we analysed human B-cell responses in a series of Phase I/IIa clinical trials, which include CHMI, using candidate virus-vectored vaccines encoding two blood-stage antigens: merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) and apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1). Previously vaccinated volunteers show boosting of pre-existing antigen-specific memory B-cell (mBC) responses following CHMI. In contrast, unvaccinated malaria-naive control volunteers developed an mBC response against MSP1 but not AMA1. Serum IgG correlated with the mBC response after booster vaccination but this relationship was less well maintained following CHMI. A significant reduction in peripheral MSP1-specific mBC was observed at the point of diagnosis of blood-stage infection. This was coincident with a reduction in peripheral blood B-cell subsets expressing CXCR3 and elevated serum levels of interferon-Î³ and CXCL9, suggesting migration away from the periphery. These CHMI data confirm that mBC and antibody responses can be induced and boosted by blood-stage parasite exposure, in support of epidemiological studies on low-level parasite exposure.",
"We have explored the pathophysiological mechanisms of orthostatic hypotension and orthostatic tachycardia, found to be present in 83% and 61% respectively of 18 patients with subsequently proven pheochromocytoma. Orthostatic increases in plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were significantly greater in the patients than in normal control subjects. Intravenous infusions of NE at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 micrograms/min induced similar increases in plasma NE levels but smaller increments in systolic and diastolic BP in the pheochromocytoma patients than in normal control subjects. This was reflected by a significantly greater increment in plasma NE concentration required to raise systolic BP by 15 mm Hg and diastolic BP by 7 mm Hg in the pheochromocytoma patients than in the normal subjects (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). Measurements of venous contractile responses to locally infused NE by the dorsal hand vein (LVDT) technique revealed significantly reduced slopes of the regressions of log NE infusion rate on change in venous diameter in the pheochromocytoma patients compared with normal subjects. The results indicate reduced responsiveness of the vasculature to NE in patients with pheochromocytoma, probably due to down-regulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors resulting from persistent elevation of the physiological agonist NE. This was shown by other authors to be present in circulating platelets. The pathophysiological importance of the subnormal venous responses to the orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia in the patients were supported by the finding that the orthostatic changes were corrected by lower body compression to 45 mm Hg with a MAST pressure suit.",

"Current oral anticoagulation prescribing patterns would suggest that bleeding risk estimation by clinicians is poor and that oral anticoagulation prescribing does not reflect bleeding risk per se. The HAS-BLED score performs well in relation to predicting bleeding events compared with older bleeding scores and the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation score, with significantly improved reclassification using HAS-BLED compared with all other bleeding risk scores tested.",

"An automated nucleic acid amplification assay that simultaneously identifies Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance, the XpertÂ® MTB/RIF test, has undergone extensive evaluation in sputum samples. Our aim was to define its diagnostic accuracy when performed on pleural fluid specimens. In 67 patients with pleural effusions, of whom half had tuberculous pleuritis, Xpert yielded 15% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the detection of tuberculosis (TB). Positive Xpert results tended to be more common in patients with microbiologically confirmed TB. Due to its low sensitivity, Xpert testing of pleural fluids has a limited role in the work-up of pleural effusions.",
"The effect of riboflavin supplementation (5mg twice daily for 8 weeks) on reduced blood glutathione (GSH) and iron status was assessed in 18 patients with sickle cell disease (SCD-HbSS). Twelve SCD patients and 13 normal (Hb-AA) subjects served as the control. The total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and serum ferritin (SF) were significantly higher (p < 0.01), but GSH level, haemoglobin and transferrin saturation (TS) were significantly lower (p < 0.001) in SCD patients than in normal subjects. The administration of riboflavin elicited a significant increase (p < 0.01) in serum iron and TS but a non significant increase in SF and circulating Hb. The GSH level varied little in riboflavin supplemented but decreased significantly in unsupplemented SCD. The disparity in GSH concentration might reflect availability of FAD for regeneration of GSH from glutathione. Likewise, the haematological improvement in the supplemented group supports the assertion that riboflavin enhances erythropoiesis. For an effective management of SCD in Africa, a closer attention should be directed to the riboflavin status in haemolytic disorders.",

"We explored the utility of T-wave alternans (TWA) in predicting mortality in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). Maximum TWA was calculated using Modified Moving Average method from continuous electrocardiographic recordings in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <40% and ventricular tachycardia (VT) â¥4 beats during index hospitalization or sudden cardiac death during theÂ follow-up year and age- and sex-matched controls in the Metabolic Efficiency withÂ Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (MERLIN-TIMI) 36 trial. All patients received standard therapy for NSTEACS plus ranolazine (nÂ = 109) or placebo (nÂ = 101). Median follow-up was 1Â year. Baseline clinical characteristics did not differ between patients with elevated TWA (â¥47Â Î¼V) compared with lower levels. Patients with TWA â¥47Â Î¼V at admission had increased risk of total mortality (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] 2.35, pÂ = 0.04) during follow-up and VT â¥4 beats (ORadj 2.70, pÂ = 0.01) during hospitalization with a trend toward increased cardiovascular death risk (ORadj 2.18, pÂ = 0.07) during follow-up. In patients receiving placebo, TWA â¥47Â Î¼V on day 6 was associated with increased risk of total mortality (OR 4.12, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 13.64, pÂ = 0.02) and cardiovascular death (OR 4.73, pÂ = 0.01) during follow-up. No deaths occurred among patients with TWA â¥47Â Î¼V assigned to ranolazine. In conclusion, in patients with NSTEACS and left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, TWA â¥47Â Î¼V early after admission is associated with increased risk of mortality at 1Â year and with nonsustained VT during hospitalization. TWA may be useful in risk estimation in patients with NSTEACS. The possibility that TWA may serve as a therapeutic target deserves further exploration.",

"Rate control of atrial fibrillation (AF) is a main treatment modality. However, data are scarce on the relative efficacy of calcium channel blockers and Î² blockers or between drugs within each class. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of 4 rate-reducing, once-daily drug regimens on the ventricular heart rate and arrhythmia-related symptoms in patients with permanent AF. We included 60 patients (mean age 71 Â± 9 years, 18 women) with permanent AF in an investigator-blind cross-over study. Diltiazem 360 mg/day, verapamil 240 mg/day, metoprolol 100 mg/day, and carvedilol 25 mg/day were administered for 3 weeks in a randomized sequence. The 24-hour heart rate was measured using Holter monitoring, and arrhythmia-related symptoms were assessed using the Symptom Checklist questionnaire before randomization and on the last day of each treatment period. The 24-hour mean heart rate was 96 Â± 12 beats/min at baseline (no treatment), 75 Â± 10 beats/min with diltiazem, 81 Â± 11 beats/min with verapamil, 82 Â± 11 beats/min with metoprolol, and 84 Â± 11 beats/min with carvedilol. All drugs reduced the heart rate compared to baseline (p <0.001 for all). The 24-hour heart rate was significantly lower with diltiazem than with any other drug tested (p <0.001 for all). Compared to baseline, diltiazem significantly reduced both the frequency (p <0.001) and the severity (pÂ = 0.005) of symptoms. In contrast, verapamil reduced symptom frequency only (pÂ =Â 0.012). In conclusion, diltiazem 360 mg/day was the most effective drug regimen for reducing the heart rate in patients with permanent AF. Arrhythmia-related symptoms were reduced by treatment with the calcium channel blockers diltiazem and verapamil, but not by the Î² blockers.",
"We evaluated the effectiveness of latanoprost (Xalatan) monotherapy in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analogue, the pure 15(R) epimer of 13,14-dihydro-17-phenyl-18,19,20-trinor-PGF2alpha-isopropyl ester. As a prodrug it is being activated by enzymatic hydrolysis in the cornea after which it becomes active acid of latanoprost. Latanoprost is lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing the uveoscleral outflow. In this study, latanoprost was used once daily as monotherapy what offers much better compliance for the patients than other combinations of drugs, preserving good IOP control. Based on the significant reduction of the IOP, measured on the day 60 of the trial (mean change in IOP was -5.1 mmHg, with 95% confidence interval in range from -5.6 to -4.5), it is concluded that use of latanoprost is advisable when calculating better IOP control, few side-effects and reductions in costs of potential surgical procedures.",

"Zinc deficiency is a common nutritional problem in adult sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients. Hyperzincuria and increased requirement of zinc due to continued hemolysis in SCD are probable bases for zinc deficiency in these patients. Zinc deficiency affects adversely T-helper1 (TH1) functions and cell mediated immunity and interleukin (IL)-2 production is decreased in zinc deficient subjects. We hypothesized that zinc supplementation will improve T-helper1 function and decrease incidence of infections in patients with SCD. We tested this hypothesis in 32 SCD subjects who were divided in three groups (Grs A, B, and C). Grs A (n = 11) and B (n = 10) were zinc deficient based on cellular zinc criteria and Gr C (n = 11) were zinc sufficient. Gr A subjects were observed for 1 year (baseline), following which they received zinc acetate (50 to 75 mg of elemental zinc orally daily) for 3 years. Gr B subjects were observed for 1 year (baseline), following which they received placebo for 1 year and then switched to zinc supplementation (50 to 75 mg of elemental zinc orally daily) for 2 years. Gr C subjects did not receive any intervention inasmuch as they were zinc sufficient. Prolonged zinc supplementation resulted in an increase in lymphocyte and granulocyte zinc (P = 0.0001), and an increase in interleukin-2 production (P = 0.0001), decreased incidence of documented bacteriologically positive infections (P = 0.0026), decreased number of hospitalizations and decreased number of vaso-occlusive pain crisis (P = 0.0001). The predominant pathogens isolated were staphylococci and streptococci involving the respiratory tract and aerobic gram-negative bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli, involving the urinary tract. Further confirmation of our observations will require prospective studies of zinc supplementation in a larger number of SCD patients.",

"From January 1993 to January 1994, scintigraphy with 123I-MIBG and/or 131I-MIBG were performed in 22 patients and their scintigraphic usefulness was evaluated. Iodine-123 MIBG and 131I-MIBG scintigrams were obtained 24 hours after injection of 222 MBq of 123I-MIBG and 48 hours after injection of 20 MBq of 131I-MIBG, respectively. In two patients with pheochromocytoma, the 123I-MIBG and 131I-MIBG scans were performed and both images were compared. In a patient with single intraadrenal pheochromocytoma, the lesion not detected with 131I-MIBG was clearly visualized with 123I-MIBG. In the other patient with multiple metastatic pheochromocytoma, much more lesions were distinctly demonstrated on the 123I-MIBG images than on the 131I-MIBG images. All of the lesions were detected with 123I-MIBG in a patient with pheochromocytoma, 3 patients with neuroblastoma and a patient with medullary thyroid cancer. Most of the normal adrenal glands (86%) were visualized on the 123I-MIBG scintigrams, in 7 patients without neural crest tumor and adrenal diseases, while 131I-MIBG scintigraphy failed to visualize normal adrenal glands in 2 hypertensive patients. The main reason for the superiority of 123I-MIBG to 131I-MIBG is considered to be as follows: 1) higher specific activity of 123I-MIBG. 2) the larger amount of 123I-MIBG used. 3) gamma ray energy of 123I is ideal for gamma camera. In conclusion, 123I-MIBG appears to be a more suitable imaging agent than 131I-MIBG in depicting neural crest tumors.",
"Habituation deficits in various sensory modalities have been observed in migraine patients in several experimental designs. The underlying neuronal mechanisms are, however, still unknown. Past studies have used electrophysiological measures and focussed on habituation behaviour during one single session. We were interested in how repeated painful stimulation over several days is processed, perceived and modulated in migraineurs. Fifteen migraine patients and 15 healthy controls were stimulated daily with a 20 min trigeminal pain paradigm for eight consecutive days, using functional MRI performed on days one and eight and one follow-up measurement three months later. The results demonstrate that migraine patients did not differ in behavioural pain ratings compared to the controls at any time. However, functional imaging data revealed a significant difference in several brain areas over time. The activity level in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) increased in healthy control subjects from day one to day eight, whereas it decreased in migraine patients. These data suggest that several brain areas known to be involved in endogenous pain control show a completely opposite behaviour in migraine patients compared to healthy controls. These brain networks seem not to be disrupted per se in migraine patients but changed activity over time responding to repetitive nociceptive input. The alteration of pain inhibitory circuits may be the underlying mechanism responsible for the dys-functional neuronal filters of sensory input.",

A total of 138 genes encoding P. falciparum merozoite proteins were cloned using the In-Fusion cloning method and expressed using a wheat germ cell-free system (WGCF). These proteins were then screened with serum from Plasmodium-exposed individuals and unexposed subjects using protein arrays.

"Echocardiography-guided left ventricular (LV) lead placement at the site of latest mechanical activation improves heart failure outcomes in patients receiving a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D). In this study, we test the hypothesis that a strategy of echocardiography-guided LV lead placement improves patient survival rate free from appropriate CRT-D therapy for ventricular arrhythmias. Patients enrolled in the prospective, randomized Speckle Tracking Assisted Resynchronization Therapy for Electrode Region trial and treated with a CRT-D device (108 with the echo-guided strategy and 75 with the routine strategy) were followed to the end point of death or first appropriate CRT-D therapy. Over a follow-up period of 3.7 Â± 2.1Â years, 62 patients (33%) died and 40Â (22%) received appropriate CRT-D therapy. Compared with the routine group, patients in the echo-guided group had improved CRT-D therapy-free survival rate (hazard ratioÂ = 0.64, 95% confidence intervalÂ = 0.42 to 0.98, pÂ = 0.038). Patients randomized to the echo-guided LV lead placement were more likely to resynchronize their LV compared with the routine group (72% vs 48%, respectively, pÂ = 0.006). Patients whose LV did resynchronize after CRT-D had improved therapy-free survival rate compared with those whose LV did not resynchronize (hazard ratioÂ = 0.49, 95% confidence intervalÂ = 0.28 to 0.86, pÂ = 0.012). In conclusion, a strategy of echo-guided LV lead placement improved the patient survival rate free from defibrillator therapy in CRT-D recipients.",

"Naturally acquired protective immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria takes years to develop. It relies mainly on Abs, particularly IgG specific for Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) proteins on the infected erythrocyte surface. It is only partially understood why acquisition of clinical protection takes years to develop, but it probably involves a range of immune-evasive parasite features, not least of which are PfEMP1 polymorphism and clonal variation. Parasite-induced subversion of immunological memory and expansion of "atypical" memory B cells may also contribute. In this first, to our knowledge, longitudinal study of its kind, we measured B cell subset composition, as well as PfEMP1-specific Ab levels and memory B cell frequencies, in Ghanaian women followed from early pregnancy up to 1 y after delivery. Cell phenotypes and Ag-specific B cell function were assessed three times during and after pregnancy. Levels of IgG specific for pregnancy-restricted, VAR2CSA-type PfEMP1 increased markedly during pregnancy and declined after delivery, whereas IgG levels specific for two PfEMP1 proteins not restricted to pregnancy did not. Changes in VAR2CSA-specific memory B cell frequencies showed typical primary memory induction among primigravidae and recall expansion among multigravidae, followed by contraction postpartum in all. No systematic changes in the frequencies of memory B cells specific for the two other PfEMP1 proteins were identified. The B cell subset analysis confirmed earlier reports of high atypical memory B cell frequencies among residents of P. falciparum-endemic areas, and indicated an additional effect of pregnancy. Our study provides new knowledge regarding immunity to P. falciparum malaria and underpins efforts to develop PfEMP1-based vaccines against this disease.",
"Angiographic and clinical outcomes remain relatively unfavorable for diabetic patients even after the use of drug-eluting stent. This prospective, multicenter, randomized study compared the relative efficacy and safety of resolute zotarolimus-eluting stent (R-ZES) and sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) implantation in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease. The primary end point was noninferiority of angiographic in-segment late loss at 9 months. Clinical events were also monitored for at least 12 months. Patient recruitment was prematurely stopped after enrollment of 256 patients (127 in R-ZES group and 129 in SES) because of discontinuing production of SES. The R-ZES was noninferior to the SES for 9-month in-segment late loss (0.34 Â± 0.30 vs 0.39 Â± 0.43 mm; difference -0.048; 95% confidence interval -0.157 to 0.061; upper 1-sided 95% confidence interval 0.044; p <0.001 for noninferiority). In addition, in-stent late loss (0.22 Â± 0.29 vs 0.21 Â± 0.40 mm, p = 0.849) and the rates of in-segment (1.2% vs 6.7%, p = 0.119) and in-stent (1.2% vs 3.3%, p = 0.621) binary restenoses were similar between the 2 groups. At 12 months, there were no statistical differences between the 2 groups in the incidence of any clinical outcomes (death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization, ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization, and composite outcomes). In conclusion, despite having reduced power because of early study termination, our study suggests that the R-ZES has noninferior angiographic outcomes at 9 months to the SES in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease.",

"Dyssynchrony is common in asymptomatic patients with hypertension. We sought to investigate the impact of antihypertensive treatment on dyssynchrony in patients with hypertension. A total of sixty patients who had uncomplicated hypertension that had never been treated (treatment-naÃ¯ve hypertensive patients) underwent echocardiographic evaluations of left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony at baseline and after a 6-month treatment with antihypertensive drugs. The measured parameters were as follows: (1) the s.d. of 12 LV-segment time-to-peak systolic velocities (Ts-SD12), and (2) the maximal difference between peak systolic velocities of any 2 of the 12 segments (Ts-Max). Patients with Ts-SD12 â¥ 33 ms or Ts-Max â¥ 100 ms were regarded as having LV systolic dyssynchrony. Patients with systolic dyssynchrony (group 1, n = 29) and without systolic dyssynchrony (group 2, n = 31) were compared. Among the patients in group 1, antihypertensive treatment significantly improved LV systolic dyssynchrony (ÎTs-SD12, -13.1 ms; P<0.001 and ÎTs-Max, -34.0 ms; P = 0.003), whereas it did not demonstrate additional benefit among group 2 patients. The change in LV systolic dyssynchrony was significantly associated with changes in the mean annulus E' velocity, mean annulus S' velocity and mean annulus E'/A' ratio, but not with changes in blood pressure and LV mass index. It is likely that chronic antihypertensive treatment could reverse the LV systolic dyssynchrony and simultaneously improve subclinical systolic and diastolic function in patients with hypertension and LV systolic dyssynchrony.",

"New tuberculosis vaccines are urgently needed to curtail the current epidemic. MVA85A is a subunit vaccine that could enhance immunity from BCG vaccination. To determine MVA85A safety and immunogenicity as well as interactions with other routine vaccines administered in infancy, we randomized healthy 4-month-old infants who had received Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin at birth to receive Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines alone, EPI and MVA85A simultaneously, or MVA85A alone. Adverse events were monitored throughout. Blood samples obtained before vaccination and at 1, 4, and 20 weeks after vaccination were used to assess safety and immunogenicity. The safety profile of both low and standard doses was comparable, but the standard dose was more immunogenic and therefore was selected for the second stage of the study. In total, 72 (first stage) and 142 (second stage) infants were enrolled. MVA85A was safe and well tolerated and induced a potent cellular immune response. Coadministration of MVA85A with EPI vaccines was associated with a significant reduction in MVA85A immunogenicity, but did not affect humoral responses to the EPI vaccines. These results provide important information regarding timing of immunizations, which is required for the design of infant efficacy trials with MVA85A, and suggest that modifications to the standard EPI schedule may be required to incorporate a new generation of T cell-inducing vaccines.",

"Functional capacity as assessed by 6-minute walk test distance (6MWTD) has been shown to predict outcomes in selected cohorts with cardiovascular disease. To evaluate the association between 6MWTD and outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) among participants in the Placement of AoRTic TraNscathetER valve (PARTNER) trial, TAVI recipients (n = 484) were stratified into 3 groups according to baseline 6MWTD: unable to walk (n = 218), slow walkers (n = 133), in whom 6MWTD was below the median (128.5 meters), and fast walkers (n = 133) with 6MWTD >128.5 meters. After TAVI, among fast walkers, follow-up 6MWTD decreased by 44 Â± 148 meters at 12 months (p <0.02 compared with baseline). In contrast, among slow walkers, 6MWTD improved after TAVI by 58 Â± 126 meters (p <0.001 compared with baseline). Similarly, among those unable to walk, 6MWTD distance increased by 66 Â± 109 meters (p <0.001 compared with baseline). There were no differences in 30-day outcomes among 6MWTD groups. At 2 years, the rate of death from any cause was 42.5% in those unable to walk, 31.2% in slow walkers, and 28.8% in fast walkers (p = 0.02), driven primarily by differences in noncardiac death. In conclusion, among high-risk older adults undergoing TAVI, baseline 6MWTD does not predict procedural outcomes but does predict long-term mortality. Nonetheless, patients with poor baseline functional status exhibit the greatest improvement in 6MWTD. Additional work is required to identify those with poor functional status who stand to benefit the most from TAVI.",

"The objective of this study was to determine the clinical effects of party pills containing benzylpiperazine (BZP) and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) when taken alone and in combination with alcohol. The study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in a hospital-based clinic in Wellington, New Zealand. Thirty-five volunteers who had previously used party pills containing BZP were included in this trial. Participants received one of the following four treatments: 300 mg/74 mg BZP/TFMPP and placebo, 300 mg/74 mg BZP/TFMPP and 57.6 g (6 units) alcohol, placebo and 57.6 g (6 units) alcohol and double placebo. The primary outcome variable was a measure of driving performance, the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) measured at 6.5 h. Secondary measures included adverse events, cardiovascular effects, psychological function and delayed effects on sleep. The study was stopped early, after 35 of the planned 64 subjects had undertaken testing, because of severe adverse events that occurred in four of 10 BZP/TFMPP-only subjects, three of seven combined BZP/TFMPP and alcohol subjects, none of the 6 placebo subjects, and none of the 12 alcohol-only subjects. The overall rate of severe adverse events (defined as causing considerable interference with usual activity and/or rated by subject as severe) in those receiving BZP/TFMPP was seven of 17 (41.2%, 95% CI 18.4-67.1). The severe events included agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, vomiting, insomnia and migraine. BZP/TFMPP significantly improved the driving performance, decreasing SDLP at -4.2 cm (95% CI -6.8 to -1.6, P = 0.002). The effect of alcohol was to increase SDLP: 2.3 cm (95% CI -0.3 to 4.9, P = 0.08). BZP/TFMPP also resulted in increased heart rate and blood pressure and in difficulty in getting to sleep. BZP/TFMPP alone or with alcohol carries a significant risk of severe adverse events when taken in similar doses to those recommended by manufacturers.",
"Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oils may have antifibrillatory effects; however, their electrophysiologic effects in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) remain unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic fish oil supplementation on human pulmonary vein (PV) and left atrial electrophysiology in PAF. Patients with PAF undergoing PV isolation were randomized â¥1 month before their procedure into a control group (n = 18) or a fish oil group (n = 18) in an unblinded fashion. The latter were supplemented with fish oil 6 g/day for a mean of 40 Â± 12 days. Pulmonary venous and left atrial effective refractory periods (ERPs), PV conduction, and susceptibility to AF initiated within PVs were assessed. Compared to the control group, the fish oil group had (1) longer left-sided (p = 0.002) and right-sided (p = 0.001) pulmonary venous ERPs; (2) less dispersion of pulmonary venous ERPs (left PVs p = 0.001, right PVs p = 0.07); (3) longer left atrial ERPs (p = 0.02); (4) no difference in pulmonary venous conduction; (5) lower incidence of AF initiated from PVs during ERP testing (77% vs 31%, p = 0.02); and (6) prolongation of mean AF cycle length (p = 0.009) and shortest AF cycle length in PVs (p = 0.04). In conclusion, patients with PAF chronically supplemented with fish oils exhibit distinctive electrophysiologic properties including prolonged pulmonary venous and left atrial ERPs and decreased susceptibility to initiation AF from within PVs. These changes may in part explain the antifibrillatory effect of chronic omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation in patients with PAF.",

"Psychotropic drugs can pose the risk of acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS). Unexpected autopsy-negative sudden death in patients taking psychotropic drugs may be associated with prolonged QT intervals and life-threatening arrhythmias. We analyzed genes that encode for cardiac ion channels and potentially associated with LQTS, examining specifically the potassium channel genes KCNQ1 and KCNH2 in 10 cases of sudden death involving patients administered psychotropic medication in which autopsy findings identified no clear cause of death. We amplified and sequenced all exons of KCNQ1 and KCNH2, identifying G643S, missense polymorphism in KCNQ1, in 6 of the 10 cases. A study analysis indicated that only 11% of 381 healthy Japanese individuals carry this polymorphism. Reports of previous functional analyses indicate that the G643S polymorphism in the KCNQ1 potassium channel protein causes mild I(Ks) channel dysfunction. Our present study suggests that administering psychotropic drug therapy to individuals carrying the G643S polymorphism may heighten the risk of prolonged QT intervals and life-threatening arrhythmias. Thus, screening for the G643S polymorphism before prescribing psychotropic drugs may help reduce the risk of unexpected sudden death.",

"In sickle cell anaemia, red cell dehydration increases intracellular HbS concentration and promotes sickling. Higher erythrocyte magnesium reduces water loss through negative regulation of membrane transporters. Hydroxycarbamide (also known as hydroxyurea) reduces sickling partly by increasing intracellular HbF. Combining drugs with distinct mechanisms could offer additive effects. A phase I trial combining oral magnesium pidolate and hydroxycarbamide was performed to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity of magnesium. Cohorts of three children with HbSS, who were on a stable dose of hydroxycarbamide (median 28.5 mg/kg/d), received magnesium pidolate for 6 months beginning at 83 mg/kg/d. The dose was escalated by 50% for subsequent cohorts. Laboratory evaluations were performed at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months. Sixteen children (aged 4-12 years) participated. All four dose-limiting toxicities (grade III diarrhoea and abdominal pain) occurred within the first month of starting magnesium. Additionally, diarrhoea grades I (n = 1) and II (n = 3), and abdominal pain grade II (n = 3) occurred. Hydroxycarbamide dose reduction or interruption was not required. The MTD for magnesium pidolate used in combination with hydroxycarbamide was 125 mg/kg/d. KCl co-transporter activity declined after 3 months of magnesium pidolate (P = 0.02). A phase II study is needed to investigate the efficacy of this drug combination.",

"Nonprocedure hospitals vary substantially in their use of the transfer process for elderly patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction. High-transfer hospitals had greater use of invasive cardiac procedures after admission compared with low-transfer hospitals. However, higher transfer rates were not associated with a significantly lower risk-standardized mortality rate at 30 days. Moreover, at 1 year there was only a 1.1% difference (42.8% vs 43.9%) between hospitals with higher and lower transfer rates. These findings suggest that, as a single intervention, promoting the transfer of patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction may not improve hospital outcomes.",
"The primary objective of the S.AGES cohort is to describe the real-life therapeutic care of elderly patients. Patients and methods.

Follow-up is planned for 3 years. Baseline characteristics. In the chronic pain sub-cohort, 33% of patients are treated with only grade 1 analgesics, 29% with grade 2 analgesics and 3% with grade 3 analgesics, and 22% have no pain treatment. In the T2DM sub-cohort, 61% of patients have well-controlled diabetes (Hb1c<7%) and 18% are treated with insulin. In the AF sub-cohort, 65% of patients have a CHADS2 score greater than 2, 77% are treated with oral anticoagulants, 17% with platelet inhibitors, 40% with antiarrhythmic drugs and 56% with rate slowing medications.

"The prevalence of subclinical TB disease was 8.5% (95% CI 5.1% to 13.0%) (n=18; median days to culture positivity 17&emsp14;days), with 22% of patients being smear-positive. Spoligotyping showed a diverse variety of genotypes with all paired isolates being of the same spoligotype, effectively excluding cross-contamination. 56% of patients followed up developed symptoms 3 days to 2 months later. All were well and still in care 6-12 months after TB diagnosis; 60% were started on ART. A positive tuberculin skin test (OR 4.96, p=0.064), low CD4 count (OR 0.996, p=0.06) and number of years since HIV diagnosis (OR 1.006, p=0.056) showed trends towards predicting TB disease. Conclusion This study found a high prevalence but good outcome (retained in care) of subclinical TB disease in HIV-1-infected persons. The results suggest that, in high HIV/TB endemic settings, a positive HIV-1 test should prompt TB screening by sputum culture irrespective of symptoms, particularly in those with a positive tuberculin skin test, longer history of HIV infection and low CD4 count. Operational difficulties in resource-constrained settings with respect to screening with TB culture highlight the need for rapid and affordable point-of-care tests to identify persons with clinical and subclinical TB disease.",

"Oral anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin reduce the risk of cardioembolic stroke by approximately two-thirds compared with no treatment, but are limited by their unpredictable anticoagulant effect and narrow therapeutic index. Warfarin therapy requires routine coagulation monitoring, which is inconvenient for patients and costly for the healthcare system. The limitations of the vitamin K agonists have spurred the development of new oral anticoagulants that selectively inhibit thrombin or factor Xa. The Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation (RE-LY) trial of 18,113 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke demonstrated that dabigatran etexilate given at a dose of 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin, reduced the rate of stroke or systemic embolism by one-third with a similar rate of major bleeding, whereas dabigatran etexilate given at a dose of 110 mg twice daily compared with warfarin had a similar rate of stroke or systemic embolism and reduced the rate of major bleeding by one-fifth. Both doses of dabigatran etexilate reduced intracranial bleeding by approximately two-thirds compared with warfarin. Based on the results of the RE-LY trial, both the US FDA and Health Canada recently approved dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.",

"A phase III clinical study of 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (131I-MIBG) was performed in 66 patients with tumors of sympathetic and adrenomedullary origin, including 32 patients with suspected pheochromocytoma, 25 with suspected neuroblastoma, 7 pre- or postoperative medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and each with carcinoid and suspected Sipple's syndrome. A total of 150 sites which were confirmed for presence (72 sites) or absence (78 sites) of tumors were examined on 131I-MIBG scintigrams. True positive ratio of the scintigraphy was 84.7% (61/72) and true negative ratio was 94.9% (74/78). Positive scintigraphy was obtained in 86.5% (32/37) of pheochromocytoma, 78.6% (22/28) of neuroblastoma and 100% (6/6) of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Accumulation of 131I-MIBG was seen in 16.8% of normal adrenal glands. Neither adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory findings were noted in relation to 131I-MIBG injections.

"The in vivo kinetics of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in patients with advanced and convalescent tuberculosis (TB) is not well characterized. In order to target Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) peptides- and HLA-DR-holding monocytes and macrophages, 2 MTB peptide-specific CD4(+) T-cell receptor (TCR) tetramers eu and hu were successfully constructed. Peripheral blood (PBL) samples from inpatients with advanced pulmonary TB (PTB) were analyzed using flow cytometry, and the percentages of tetramer-bound CD14(+) monocytes ranged from 0.26-1.44% and 0.21-0.95%, respectively; significantly higher than those measured in PBL samples obtained from non-TB patients, healthy donors, and umbilical cords. These tetramers were also able to specifically detect macrophages in situ via immunofluorescent staining. The results of the continuous time-point tracking of the tetramer-positive rates in PBL samples from active PTB outpatients undergoing treatment show that the median percentages were at first low before treatment, increased to their highest levels during the first month, and then began to decrease during the second month until finally reaching and maintaining a relatively low level after 3-6 months. These results suggest that there is a relatively low level of MTB-specific monocytes in advanced and untreated patients. Further experiments show that MTB induces apoptosis in CD14(+) cells, and the percentage of apoptotic monocytes dramatically decreases after treatment. Therefore, the relatively low level of MTB-specific monocytes is probably related to the apoptosis or necrosis of APCs due to live bacteria and their growth. The bactericidal effects of anti-TB drugs, as well as other unknown factors, would induce a peak value during the first month of treatment, and a relatively low level would be subsequently reached and maintained until all of the involved factors reached equilibrium. These tetramers have diagnostic potential and can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of antigen presentation and its relationship with TB infection and latent TB infection.",

"Intensive statin therapy is a central component of secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), particularly among high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the frequency and predictors of intensive statin therapy use after AMI among patients with DM have not been described. We examined patterns of intensive statin therapy use (defined as a statin with expected low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering of >50%) at discharge among patients with AMI with known DM enrolled in a 24-site US registry. Predictors of intensive statin therapy use were evaluated using multivariable hierarchical Poisson regression models. Among 1,300 patients with DM after AMI, 22% were prescribed intensive statin therapy at hospital discharge. In multivariable models, ST-elevation AMI (risk ratio [RR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29 to 1.70), insurance for medications (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.63), and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (RR 1.05 per 1Â mg/dl, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.07) were independent predictors of intensive statin therapy, whereas higher Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events scores were associated with lower rates of intensive statin therapy (RR 0.94 per 10 points, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98). In conclusion, only 1 in 5 patients with DM was prescribed intensive statin therapy at discharge after an AMI. Predictors of intensive statin therapy use suggest important opportunities to improve quality of care in this patient population.",

"We showed reduced motor intracortical inhibition (ICI) and paradoxical increase of intracortical facilitation (ICF) to 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients affected by migraine with aura (MA). In conditions of enhanced excitability due to a reduced inhibition, high-frequency rTMS was found to potentiate intracortical inhibition. Here we explored the conditioning effects of high-frequency priming stimulation of motor cortex with the aim of normalizing excitability reverting paradoxical facilitation by 1 Hz rTMS in MA. Nine patients with MA and nine healthy controls underwent a paired-pulse TMS paradigm to evaluate motor intracortical excitability (ICI and ICF) before and after the following rTMS conditions: 1 Hz alone or preceded by a real or sham conditioning high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS. Sham was used to control for rTMS specificity. In baseline, ICI was significantly lower in migraineurs with respect to controls. One hertz stimulation reduced motor evoked potential amplitude and ICF in healthy controls, while it caused a significant paradoxical ICF increase in migraineurs. High-frequency rTMS conditioning normalized excitability in migraine, increasing short ICI and so reversing the paradoxical effects of 1 Hz rTMS. These findings raise the possibility that the interictal reduced intracortical inhibition in migraine could be normalized by high-frequency rTMS. This would open perspectives for new treatment strategies in migraine prevention.",

The groups were matched according to age, gender, and frequency of migraine attacks prior to treatment. The period of treatment was two months and the frequency and intensity of headache attacks of the 30 days pre-treatment period were compared with the frequency of headaches in the treatment period. Fourteen patients in groups A and B and sixteen patients in group C have completed the study. Treatment with propranolol, alone or in combination, was shown to be effective. Treatment with nortriptyline alone was not effective. All three therapeutic regimens were safe and side effects were minimal. The frequency of discontinuation of the study was the same in the 3 groups but no patient left the study due to adverse reactions. The combined therapy proved to be as safe as the monotherapy.

Maf is more likely to cause TB in immune suppressed individuals, implying differences in virulence. Despite this, few studies have assessed the underlying immunity to the two pathogens in human. In this study, we analyzed T-cell responses from 19 Maf- and 29 Mtb-infected HIV-negative patients before and after TB chemotherapy following overnight stimulation of whole blood with TB-specific antigens. Before treatment, percentages of early secreted antigenic target-6(ESAT-6)/culture filtrate protein-10(CFP-10) and purified protein derivative-specific single-TNF-Î±-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were significantly higher while single-IL-2-producing T cells were significantly lower in Maf- compared with Mtb-infected patients. Purified protein derivative-specific polyfunctional CD4(+) T cells frequencies were significantly higher before than after treatment, but there was no difference between the groups at both time points. Furthermore, the proportion of CD3(+) CD11b(+) T cells was similar in both groups pretreatment, but was significantly lower with higher TNF-Î±, IL-2, and IFN-Î³ production in Mtb- compared with that of Maf-infected patients posttreatment. Our data provide evidence of differences in T-cell responses to two mycobacterial strains with differing virulence, providing some insight into TB pathogenesis with different Mtb strains that could be prospectively explored as biomarkers for TB protection or susceptibility.",

At study entry, infants with alpha thalassemia trait had significantly lower mean corpuscular volume, total bilirubin, and absolute reticulocyte count. Beta-globin haplotypes associated with milder disease had significantly higher hemoglobin and %HbF. BCL11A and XmnI polymorphisms had significant effects on baseline HbF, while UGT1A1 promoter polymorphisms significantly influenced baseline serum bilirubin. At study exit, subjects randomized to placebo still exhibited laboratory effects of alpha thalassemia and other modifiers, while those assigned hydroxyurea had treatment effects that exceeded most genetic influences. The pain phenotype was influenced by HbF modifiers in both treatment groups. These data document that genetic polymorphisms do modify laboratory and clinical phenotypes even in very young patients with SCA. The hydroxyurea effects are more potent, however, indicating that treatment criteria should not be limited to certain genetic subsets, and supporting the use of hydroxyurea for all young patients with SCA.",

"In Ireland, there are four anticoagulants available for prescribing to patients with atrial fibrillation for stroke prevention. A key feature of the three most recent anticoagulants is that monitoring is redundant. Despite this, there is continued prescribing of the incumbent anticoagulant, warfarin, which requires monitoring. Lack of information regarding the cost of monitoring, and the extra burden it places on health budgets and patients, motivated this costing study. Using micro costing, the costs of warfarin treatment (including monitoring) was disaggregated and isolated from both the patients' and health care provider's perspectives in a Cork hospital. Costs to the health care provider per patient per clinic visited were 21.57 Euros. Patient costs incurred per patient per clinic were 48.50 Euros. Thus, the total costs per patient per visit were 70.07 Euros. This result reveals that while the pharmaceutical cost of warfarin is low; it is not an inexpensive therapy when monitoring costs are considered.",

"Topically applied ophthalmic drugs are a potential cause of allergic contact dermatitis of the periorbital region. The objectives of this study were to assess the frequency and spectrum of contact allergy to topically applied beta-blocker containing eye drops. Data of the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) collected between 1993 and 2004 was analysed. Out of 112,430 patch-tested patients, 332 had been tested with their own topical anti-glaucoma eye drops containing different beta-blockers because of suspected allergic contact dermatitis. The frequency of positive test reactions was related to exposure intensity, as estimated by annual prescription rates in Germany. A total of 43/332 (12.95%) showed at least one positive patch test reaction. Positive reactions were observed to products containing timolol (n = 21), metipranolol (n = 13) and levobunolol (n = 11) without conceivable cross-reactivity. Whereas exposure to beta-blocker-containing eye drops remained stable over the years, as estimated by the prescription rates, a slight, non-significant increase in positive patch-reactions to these substances was noted. This is the first systematic analysis of a large set of data on patients' own beta-blocker topical medications, the results indicating that contact allergy should be considered as important, if rare, adverse event caused by this family of drugs.",

No specific effects were observed when the data were analyzed according to sex. No subject showed outlier QTcF intervals > 480 ms or a time-matched change from baseline > 60 ms. Moxifloxacin confirmed assay sensitivity for QTcF interval prolongation; the lower bound of the 2-sided 90% CIs at 3 hours postdose was 11.7 ms (> 5 ms).",
"Medicinal herbs, used in indigenous medicines in crude forms for the management of diabetes mellitus, contain both the organic and inorganic constituents.

Twenty five of each, male and female, diabetic patients, selected from Fatima Jinnah Medical College, Lahore, Pakistan, taking oral hypoglycemic drug were included in this study and were given orally the extract (5 mL) of bark of Ficus racemosa (about 100 mg) two times for 15 days. Blood samples for estimation of blood glucose and parameters of liver and renal functions were estimated. It was observed that after taking the herb in combination with drug, blood glucose level (fasting and after breakfast) was markedly decreased in both male and female but significant difference was only observed in sugar level of males after 1.5 h after breakfast. To rule out herb toxicity, liver and renal functions tests of patients was also performed which were observed to be in normal range. Present investigation established a pharmacological evidence to support the folklore claim that Ficus racemosa is good anti-diabetic agent.",
"Fourteen adults with spontaneous pneumothorax (SP), 9 of whom had primary SP (PSP) and 5 of whom had secondary forms (SSP), were given intrapleural infusions of self-donated blood for pleurodesis. Instillations of 50 ml were given to all except 1, who required a total volume of 120 ml. The procedure was performed in each patient's bed in all cases. With apical chest tube placement in most cases and the lung expanded, the outer tip of the tube was elevated and the patient's own blood was taken from a superficial forearm vein and instilled. Them, with the tube occluded, the patient's were rotated un bed for a period of 2 hours to distribute the blood evenly throughout the pleural cavity. Tolerance was excellent, with no pain reported by any patient. The only noteworthy complication was 1 case of infectious pleural effusion of unknown etiology which was treated by evacuation and antibiotics. In 13 (92%) patients closure of the fistula was achieved, in under 12 h in 7 (53%), in under 24 h in 3 (23%), in under 48 h in 2 (15%), and in under 72 h in the remaining 2 (15%). In 4 (28.5%) there was recurrence (2 SSP and 2 PSP patients). Over a 10 to 32 month follow-up period (mean 16 months), 10 (71.4%) patients experienced no recurrences or complications. These results allow us to speculate that blood instilled in the pleural cavity may act in 2 ways: in the short term as a blood patch that adheres to and closes the fistula in the visceral pleura, and over the longer term by creating pleural symphysis by adhesions and fibrous tissue. Our limited experience indicates that pleurodesis with self-donated blood is an easy-to-perform, painless, convenient, rapid and inexpensive procedure that is moderately effective in the short and medium term. Its main drawbacks are the lack of consensus on certain technical considerations, such as the optimum amount of blood to be instilled, the number of instillations to perform and, if multiple instillations are carried out, what the interval between them should be. Further study is needed to confirm or discount our results and to determine the place this technique may have in the clinical management of pneumothorax.",

"We assessed the effect of mass azithromycin treatment on malaria parasitemia in a trachoma trial in Niger. Twenty-four study communities received treatment during the wet, high-transmission season. Twelve of the 24 communities were randomized to receive an additional treatment during the dry, low-transmission season. Outcome measurements were conducted at the community-level in children < 1-72 months of age in May-June 2011. Parasitemia was higher in the 12 once-treated communities (29.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 21.5-40.0%) than in the 12 twice-treated communities (19.5%, 95% CI = 13.0-26.5%, P = 0.03). Parasite density was higher in once-treated communities (354 parasites/Î¼L, 95% CI = 117-528 parasites/Î¼L) than in twice-treated communities (74 parasites/Î¼L, 95% CI = 41-202 parasites/Î¼L, P = 0.03). Mass distribution of azithromycin reduced malaria parasitemia 4-5 months after the intervention. The results suggest that drugs with antimalaria activity can have long-lasting impacts on malaria during periods of low transmission.",
"The recombinant circumsporozoite protein (CS) based vaccine, RTS,S, confers protection against Plasmodium falciparum infection in controlled challenge trials and in field studies. The RTS,S recombinant antigen has been formulated with two adjuvant systems, AS01 and AS02, which have both been shown to induce strong specific antibody responses and CD4 T cell responses in adults. As infants and young children are particularly susceptible to malaria infection and constitute the main target population for a malaria vaccine, we have evaluated the induction of adaptive immune responses in young children living in malaria endemic regions following vaccination with RTS,S/AS01(E) and RTS,S/AS02(D). Our data show that a CS-specific memory B cell response is induced one month after the second and third vaccine dose and that CS-specific antibodies and memory B cells persist up to 12 months after the last vaccine injection. Both formulations also induced low but significant amounts of CS-specific IL-2(+) CD4(+) T cells one month after the second and third vaccine dose, upon short-term in vitro stimulation of whole blood cells with peptides covering the entire CS derived sequence in RTS,S. These results provide evidence that both RTS,S/AS01(E) and RTS,S/AS02(D) induced adaptive immune responses including antibodies, circulating memory B cells and CD4(+) T cells directed against P. falciparum CS protein.",

"We performed a prospective comparative study to examine, from a pharmacogenetics perspective, the effect of rifampicin (RIF) on long-term efavirenz (EFV) autoinduction and kinetics. In a study population of patients with HIV receiving EFV with RIF (arm 2, n = 54) or without RIF (arm 1, n = 128 controls), intraindividual and interindividual plasma EFV and 8-hydroxyefavirenz levels were compared at weeks 4 and 16 of EFV therapy. In arm 2, RIF was initiated 4 weeks before starting EFV. In controls (arm 1), the plasma EFV was significantly lower whereas 8-hydroxyefavirenz was higher at week 16 as compared to week 4. By contrast, there were no significant differences in plasma EFV and 8-hydroxyefavirenz concentrations over time in arm 2. At week 4, the plasma EFV concentration was significantly lower in arm 2 as compared to arm 1, but no significant differences were observed by week 16. When stratified by CYP2B6 genotype, significant differences were observed only with respect to CYP2B6*1/*1 genotypes. Ours is the first report of the CYP2B6 genotype-dependent effect of RIF on long-term EFV autoinduction.",
"Pleurodesis provoked by instillation of silver nitrate as prevention against recurrence in primary spontaneous pneumothorax has been used for many years in the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen. The treatment was originally instituted on a theoretical empiric basis. In a prospective, controlled investigation of pleurodesis versus simple drainage the empiric observations have been confirmed. With simple drainage we found ipsilateral recurrence of pneumothorax in 45%, while no recurrences in the pleurodesis group were found during an observation period of 5-19 months. The difference was statistically significant. The therapeutical gain using pleurodesis was 45% +/- 30%. Silver nitrate pleurodesis results in a longer hospitalization, raises the number of pleurocentesis because of increased pleural effusion and results in more pain than simple drainage. It is, however, our experience that the considerable therapeutical gain more than compensates for these negative effects. We recommend pleurodesis as the treatment of choice in primary spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with only tiny blebs on the surface of the lungs.",

Furthermore, few attempts have been made in the literature to codify the diagnostic workup and treatment. The aim of the present study is to report the results of a nationwide fact-finding survey, focused on current practice in the management of spontaneous pneumothorax by thoracic surgeons. A questionnaire, consisting of items in 6 major areas, was prepared and e-mailed to 49 thoracic surgery units in Italy. Thirty-five centres responded. The results (collected in a database presented at the XXX Congress of the Italian Society of Thoracic Surgeons in October 2006) show agreement on some questions (surgical indications, thoracoscopy as the first-choice surgical technique, use of mechanical staplers...) and a great variability of ideas and attitudes on others (CT scanning in primary spontaneous pneumothorax, definition of persistent air-leak, clamping of the chest tube before removal, pleurodesis techniques, postoperative chest X-ray schedule...).

"The urinary trypsin inhibitor (ulinastatin) is used in the clinic to prevent inflammatory responses in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB); however, the anti-inflammatory mechanism is unclear. In the current study, we recruited 40 patients undergoing selective cardiac valve replacement surgery; and these patients were randomly divided into two groups (ulinastatin group [UG] and control group [CG]). We collected peripheral blood preoperatively, at the end of CPB, and postoperative days 1 and 3 and analyzed the kinetic changes in regulatory T (Treg) cell subsets. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of CD4(+) T cells between the two groups. The number of CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells, especially the suppressive activated Treg (aTreg) subset, was higher in the UG than the CG 1 and 3 days postoperatively. Thus, ulinastatin alleviated the inflammatory response during CPB by inducing the expansion of aTreg cells.",
"Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) blunts the reversal of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) after exercise training. Metabolic inflexibility has been implicated in the etiology of insulin resistance; however, the efficacy of exercise on peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity or substrate utilization in adults with IFG, IGT, or IFG + IGT is unknown. Twenty-four older (66.7 Â± 0.8 yr) obese (34.2 Â± 0.9 kg/m(2)) adults were categorized as IFG (n = 8), IGT (n = 8), or IFG + IGT (n = 8) according to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Subjects underwent 12-wk of exercise (60 min/day for 5 days/wk at â¼85% HRmax) and were instructed to maintain a eucaloric diet. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (40 mUÂ·m(2)Â·min(-1)) with [6,6-(2)H]glucose was used to determine peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity. Nonoxidative glucose disposal and metabolic flexibility [insulin-stimulated respiratory quotient (RQ) minus fasting RQ] were also assessed. Glucose incremental area under the curve (iAUCOGTT) was calculated from the OGTT. Exercise increased clamp-derived peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity more in adults with IFG or IGT alone than with IFG + IGT (P < 0.05). Exercise reduced glucose iAUCOGTT in IGT only (P < 0.05), and the decrease in glucose iAUCOGTT was inversely correlated with the increase in peripheral but not hepatic insulin sensitivity (P < 0.01). Increased clamp-derived peripheral insulin sensitivity was also correlated with enhanced metabolic flexibility, reduced fasting RQ, and higher nonoxidative glucose disposal (P < 0.05). Adults with IFG + IGT had smaller gains in clamp-derived peripheral insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility, which was related to blunted improvements in postprandial glucose. Additional work is required to assess the molecular mechanism(s) by which chronic hyperglycemia modifies insulin sensitivity following exercise training.",
"A double blind controlled trial of supplementation with folic acid has been performed in 117 children with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease aged 6 months to 4 years over a 1 year period. No megaloblastic change was observed in either group. At the end of the study period the folate supplemented group showed no significant differences in haemoglobin, growth characteristics, or in the proportion of children affected by major or minor infections, acute splenic sequestration, dactylitis or episodes of bone or abdominal pain. However, the folate supplemented group showed a significantly lower mean cell volume and the placebo group contained a significant excess of children experiencing multiple episodes of dactylitis. The results are compatible with mild folate deficiency in some patients in the placebo group but the absence of striking effects on haematology or growth suggest that the policy of regular folate supplementation in children with SS disease should be critically reviewed.",

The trial included 5475 patients treated with vasobral in dosage 2 ml (1 ml contains 1 mg of alpha-dihydroergocryptine and 10 mg of caffeine) twice a day during 2 months. Assessment criteria of treatment efficacy were frequency and duration of migraine seizures, pain syndrome severity, presence of concomitant syndromes, general state and working capacity of patients and side-effects. Vasobral was effective and safe medication for the prevention of migraine. Its preventive effect is due to the decrease of frequency and duration of migraine seizures, pain severity and to the overall improvement of patient's state. Vasobral can be recommended to many migraine patients, in particular to those in the young age and with short disease duration.",

"The aim of this prospective study was to determine the rate of recurrence for spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) after tetracycline pleurodesis (TCP), using that of observation, tube thoracostomy alone, and thoracotomy as references. From 1985 to the end of 1991, 78 patients were treated with tetracycline pleurodesis and 135 patients served as control subjects. Pleurodesis was induced by instillation of tetracycline and ascorbic acid through the pleural drain. The indication was any SP treated with tube thoracostomy, without active pulmonary infection. Follow-up period was from 13 to 95 months (mean, 45 months); follow-up rate was 94 percent. Post-therapy surgery was necessary for eight patients in whom pleurodesis failed due to presence of a persistent air leak. The ipsilateral recurrence rate of patients treated with TCP was 9 percent (6/66) and recurrence time ranged from 2 days to 9 months. The recurrence rate for patients treated with observation was 36 percent, 35 percent for those having chest tube alone, and none for those undergoing surgery. No death occurred as a direct result of this procedure and all patients could be released from the hospital. Eleven subjects died during the follow-up period; the mean follow-up until death was 37 months (range, 2 to 87 months). Five deaths were due to respiratory causes and six were due to extrapulmonary causes. Tetracycline pleurodesis has been shown to be a good alternative for the prevention of recurrence of SP. Its recurrence rate is lower than that of tube drainage but higher than that of surgical treatment.",
"Despite improving success rate of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusion (CTO) lesions, the clinical benefit of recanalization of CTO is still a matter of debate. Of 13,087 patients who underwent PCI in the CREDO-Kyoto registry cohort-2, 1,524 patients received PCI for CTO (CTO-PCI). Clinical outcomes were compared between 1,192 patients with successful CTO-PCI and 332 patients with failed CTO-PCI. In-hospital death tended to occur less frequently in the successful CTO-PCI group than in the failed CTO-PCI group (1.4% vs 3.0%, p = 0.053). Through 3-year follow-up, the cumulative incidence of all-cause death was not significantly different between the successful and failed CTO-PCI groups (9.0% vs 13.1%, p = 0.18), whereas the cumulative incidence of cardiac death was significantly less in the successful CTO-PCI group than in the failed CTO-PCI group (4.5% vs 8.4%, p = 0.03). However, after adjusting confounders, successful CTO-PCI was associated with lesser risk for neither all-cause death (hazard ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.37, p = 0.69) nor cardiac death (hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.16, p = 0.16). The cumulative incidence of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was remarkably less in patients with successful PCI compared with those with failed PCI (1.8% vs 19.6%, p <0.0001). In conclusion, successful CTO-PCI compared with failed PCI was not associated with lesser risk for 3-year mortality. However, successful CTO-PCI was associated with significantly less subsequent CABG.",

This retrospective analysis illustrated that less frequent testing delays confirmation of bacteriological conversion. This would prolong intensive treatment, hospitalization and respiratory isolation, increasing cost and toxicity. After conversion, less frequent testing could delay diagnosis of possible treatment failure.",
"Migraine with aura affects ~20-30 % of migraineurs and it is much less common than migraine without aura. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of frovatriptan 2.5 mg and zolmitriptan 2.5 mg in the treatment of migraine with aura. Analysis was carried out in a subset of 18 subjects with migraine with aura (HIS criteria) out of the 107 enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. According to the study design, each patient had to treat three episodes of migraine in no more than 3 months with one drug, before switching to the other treatment. The rate of pain-free episodes at 2 h was significantly (p < 0.05) larger under frovatriptan (45.8 %) than under zolmitriptan (16.7 %). Pain free at 4 h, pain relief at 2 and 4 h and recurrent episodes were similar between the two treatments, while sustained pain-free episode was significantly (p < 0.05) more frequent during frovatriptan treatment (33.3 vs. 8.3 % zolmitriptan). Our study suggests that frovatriptan is superior to zolmitriptan in the immediate treatment of patients with migraine with aura, and it is capable of maintaining its acute analgesic effect over 48 h.",
"The mean cost of care for AF patients admitted via the emergency department is strongly associated with the degree of severity. Approximately 85% of the total cost is related to the cost of hospital days and medical procedures. Hypertension is the most common secondary diagnosis.

"Epidemiological studies have argued that green tea could mitigate diabetes and its complications. This study investigated the phytophenolic profile of Mauritian green tea and its antioxidant propensity. The effect of green tea on the risk factors: waist-hip ratio, glucose level, arterial pressure, antioxidant status, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in prediabetics was assessed. The experimental group consumed 3 cups of green tea daily for 14 weeks followed by a 2-week washout period. The control group followed a water regimen. Green tea contained high level of phenolics related to its antioxidant power. Green tea suppressed waist-hip ratio of women from a significant increase and suppressed mean arterial pressure of men and women from a significant decrease after week 14. It reduced ALT level in women by 13.0% (P < 0.1) while increasing the antioxidant potential of men and women sera by 2.7% (P < 0.1) and 5.1% (P < 0.1). The study timescale may have been too short to enable demonstration of effects on fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c outcomes. Green tea regimen could form part of a healthy lifestyle that might ameliorate features of metabolic syndrome and subsequent risks for diabetes and its complications. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01248143.",

"Migraine is a common neurological disorder and epidemiological studies have documented its high social and economic impact. Unfortunately, preventive treatment is often insufficient to substantially reduce migraine frequency or it is not well tolerated. Antiepileptic drugs are increasingly used in migraine prevention. However, data on efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in patients with migraine are still lacking. Our aim was to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of pregabalin in patients with migraine. We recruited 47 patients who started pregabalin at 75Â mg/day, which was titrated to 300Â mg/day as tolerated. A total of six patients (13%) reported one or more side effects during the intake of pregabalin; however, three of them discontinued pregabalin, because side effects were intolerable and persistent. Statistically significant reduction in migraine frequency compared to baseline (pÂ <Â 0.001) was evident after 1 and 3Â months of treatment. A greater frequency reduction was observed in those patients who increased the dosage within the first month of therapy. Our data suggest that pregabalin may be well tolerated and may represent an alternative preventive treatment in migraneurs. Limitations of the present study were a small sample size and an uncontrolled, open-label design; further randomized case-control studies are warranted to confirm our findings.",

"In the United States, Latinos experience disproportionately higher rates of type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related complications than non-Latino whites. Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is strongly associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Reducing caloric intake, particularly from energy-dense, low-nutrient foods or beverages, can be an effective and key strategy for metabolic and weight control. However, little is known about the contribution of various types of beverages, including but not limited to SSBs, to total caloric intake among Latinos with type 2 diabetes. Low-income Latinos (87.7% Puerto Rican) participating in a diabetes self-management intervention trial (N=238) provided cross-sectional, descriptive data on beverage-consumption patterns, anthropometric outcomes, and metabolic characteristics. Beverages accounted for one fifth of the total daily caloric intake. SSBs and milk beverages, respectively, contributed 9.6% of calories to overall daily caloric intake. Interventions directed at diabetes risk factors among low-income Latinos with diabetes can benefit from consideration of beverage-consumption behaviors as an important strategy to reduce caloric and sugar intake.",

"We explored trends in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) event rates in Norway during 1994 to 2009 and trends in the 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year risk of recurrences after an incident AMI during 2001 to 2008 in men and women â¥25 years. Trends in AMI event rates (incident and recurrent) were analyzed using joinpoint regression analyses and expressed as annual percentage change (APC) in rates. Trends in AMI recurrences were explored using conditional risk models for ordered events in Cox regression. Analyses were stratified by gender and age group. Overall, AMI rates were stable during 1994 to 2002 but declined during 2002 to 2009 (APC = -2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.1 to -0.9 in men; APC = -2.1; 95% CI -3.8 to -0.5 in women). In the younger age group, rates declined during the whole study period in men (APC = -0.6; 95% CI -1.0 to -0.3) but not in women. Among older patients, no changes were observed during 1994 to 2002, whereas rates declined during 2002 to 2009 (APC = -2.6; 95% CI -3.8 to -1.4 in men; APC = -2.4; 95% CI -4.0 to -0.7 in women). During 2001 to 2008, in the older age group, the 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year risks of recurrences were reduced annually by 4.7%, 4.3%, and 5.4% in men and 5.2%, 5.0%, and 5.7% in women (all ptrend <0.001), respectively. No changes were observed in the younger age group. In conclusion, favorable trends in AMI event rates and recurrences observed in Norway were mostly seen among patients aged 65+ years, whereas less favorable trends were observed among younger patients, especially among women.",
"During a median follow-up period of 3.9 years, participants who were assigned to extended-release niacin-laropiprant had an LDL cholesterol level that was an average of 10 mg per deciliter (0.25 mmol per liter as measured in the central laboratory) lower and an HDL cholesterol level that was an average of 6 mg per deciliter (0.16 mmol per liter) higher than the levels in those assigned to placebo. Assignment to niacin-laropiprant, as compared with assignment to placebo, had no significant effect on the incidence of major vascular events (13.2% and 13.7% of participants with an event, respectively; rate ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.03; P=0.29). Niacin-laropiprant was associated with an increased incidence of disturbances in diabetes control that were considered to be serious (absolute excess as compared with placebo, 3.7 percentage points; P<0.001) and with an increased incidence of diabetes diagnoses (absolute excess, 1.3 percentage points; P<0.001), as well as increases in serious adverse events associated with the gastrointestinal system (absolute excess, 1.0 percentage point; P<0.001), musculoskeletal system (absolute excess, 0.7 percentage points; P<0.001), skin (absolute excess, 0.3 percentage points; P=0.003), and unexpectedly, infection (absolute excess, 1.4 percentage points; P<0.001) and bleeding (absolute excess, 0.7 percentage points; P<0.001).",
"Features of the metabolic syndrome are independent risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus (NODM) related to statin therapy. Obesity is the predominant underlying risk factor for the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. This study investigated whether change in body weight may predict NODM in statin-treated patients. A total of 7,595 patients without prevalent diabetes mellitus at baseline from the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study were included in this analysis. They were randomized to atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg/day and monitored for a median of 4.9 years. NODM developed in 659 patients (8.1% in the 10-mg group and 9.2% in the 80-mg group). There was a significant increase in body weight (0.9 kg, p <0.01 in both men and women) over 1 year after randomization. The increase in body weight was greater in patients with NODM than those without NODM (1.6 vs 0.9 kg, p <0.001). The association of change in body weight with NODM risk remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors (hazard ratios 1.33, 1.42, and 1.88 for quartiles 2, 3, and 4 compared with quartile 1, respectively). Similar results were obtained in patients with normal fasting glucose level. In conclusion, 1-year change in body weight is predictive of NODM in patients who underwent statin therapy from the TNT trial. Our study highlights the importance of weight control as a lifestyle measure to prevent statin-related NODM.",
"The aim of this randomized, prospective, masked clinical study has been to verify the influence of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ophthalmic solution on intraocular pressure reduction induced by 0.5% timolol and 0.005% latanoprost eyedrops in patients affected by primary open-angle glaucoma. Thirty-two glaucomatous patients, compensated with 0.5% timolol, were randomized into two study groups (A and B). Timolol was continued for the first 2 weeks in all subjects. On the 15th day, in both groups timolol was replaced by latanoprost, and this regimen lasted up to the end of the follow-up (8 weeks). At the beginning of the 2nd week of the study, group A additionally started a 5-week therapy with topical 0.1% diclofenac; during the same period, group B received placebo eyedrops with identical modalities. Intraocular pressure was recorded at 7-day intervals during the first 7 weeks and at the 10th week. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and placebo did not modify the effect of timolol on intraocular pressure. In both groups, latanoprost induced a significant decrease in intraocular pressure. Diclofenac-treated patients exhibited a marked fall in intraocular pressure (p<0.01), whereas in placebo-treated patients, this diminution was less noticeable (p<0.05). After diclofenac withdrawal, in group A intraocular pressure significantly increased (p<0.01), remaining approximately at the same level up to the end of the study. In group B, at the same checks no significant variations in intraocular pressure occurred. In primary open-angle glaucoma patients, diclofenac significantly enhances the hypotensive effect of latanoprost, without influence on timolol efficacy. Because non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely employed in medical practice, supplementary ophthalmologic checks should be scheduled during the co-administration of these compounds and prostaglandin analogues.",

"It is not known whether the extent and severity of nonculprit coronary lesions correlate with outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We sought to quantify complex plaques in patients with STEMI referred for primary PCI and to determine their effect on short- and long-term clinical outcomes by examining the core laboratory database for plaque analysis from the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction study. Baseline demographic, angiographic, and procedural details were compared between patients with single versus multiple complex plaques who underwent single-vessel PCI. Multivariable analysis was performed for predictors of long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), a combined end point of death, reinfarction, ischemic target-vessel revascularization, or stroke, and for death alone. Single-vessel PCI was performed in 3,137 patients (87%): 2,174 (69%) had multiple complex plaques and 963 (31%) had a single complex plaque. Compared with those with a single complex plaque, patients with multiple complex plaques were older (p <0.0001) and had more co-morbidities. The presence of multiple complex plaques was an independent predictor of 3-year MACE (hazard ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.98, p <0.0001), and death alone (hazard ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.70, p = 0.03). In conclusion, multiple complex plaques are present in the majority of patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI, and their presence is an independent predictor of short- and long-term MACE, including death (Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction; NCT00433966).",

"In this study, we determined the effects of glutathione (GSH)-enhancing agents in restoring the levels of GSH in isolated macrophages from individuals with HIV infection thereby resulting in improved control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our results indicate that treatment with N-acetyl cysteine or a liposomal formulation of glutathione (lGSH) resulted in replenishment of reduced also known as free GSH (rGSH), and correlated with a decrease in the intracellular growth of M. tuberculosis. Finally, we observed differences in the amount of the catalytic subunit of glutamine-cysteine ligase (GCLC), glutathione synthase, and glutathione reductase present in macrophages derived from healthy and HIV-infected individuals. These changes correlated with changes in free radicals as well as rGSH levels. Our results indicate that HIV infection leads to increased production of free radicals and decreased production of GCLC resulting in depletion of rGSH and this may lead, in part, to the loss of innate immune function observed in HIV patients. These findings represent a novel mechanism for control of M. tuberculosis infection, and a possible supplement to current HIV treatments.",

"Early diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) can improve long-term prognosis. MTC can be detected at an early stage by calcitonin screening in all patients with thyroid nodules. This approach, however, is controversial due to high costs and a limited specificity of calcitonin. It was the aim of the present study to investigate whether ultrasonography may contribute to the diagnosis of MTC in patients with thyroid nodules. The study included 19 patients with newly diagnosed MTC. Ten patients had sporadic MTC, 7 had multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A, and 2 patients had MEN 2B. In all subjects conventional ultrasound, and in 14 patients color Doppler sonography were performed before primary surgery. For comparison, ultrasound appearance of 139 benign thyroid nodules was evaluated. In conventional ultrasound, MTC in 17/19 (89%) patients were hypoechoic, contained intranodular calcifications, and had no "halo sign". The combination of these criteria were found in only 8/139 (6%) of benign thyroid nodules. Intranodular blood flow was found in 11/14 patients with MTC (79%), perinodular blood flow in 7/14 MTC (50%). In conclusion, conventional ultrasound reveals a combination of hypoechogenicity, intranodular calcifications, and absence of "halo sign" in the vast majority of MTC. Since this sonographic pattern only rarely occurs in benign thyroid nodules, the results indicate that thyroid ultrasound can contribute to the diagnosis of MTC. In addition, the findings may have implications for calcitonin screening in nodular thyroid disease.",

"Up to 1/3 of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) are complicated by troponin release. Remote ischemic preconditioning (IPC) confers effective cardioprotection; however, a 30-minute remote IPC protocol may be difficult to implement during ad hoc PCI. This study was performed to assess the ability of a brief remote IPC protocol to attenuate cardiac troponin I (cTnI) release after ad hoc PCI. Ninety-four patients undergoing ad hoc PCI for stable coronary artery disease, with undetectable preprocedural cTnI, were recruited and randomized to receive remote IPC (induced by one 5-minute inflation of a blood pressure cuff to 200 mm Hg around the upper arm) or control after the decision for PCI was made. The primary outcome was the difference between cTnI levels 24 hours after PCI and cTnI levels before coronary angiography (ÎcTnI). ÎcTnI in the remote IPC group was significantly lower compared with the control group (0.04 ng/ml [interquartile range 0.01 to 0.14] vs 0.19 ng/ml [interquartile range 0.18 to 0.59], p <0.001). The incidence of PCI-related myocardial infarction (MI) was greater in the control group (42.6% vs 19.1%, p = 0.014). In multivariate analysis, remote IPC was independently associated with ÎcTnI and PCI-related MI. In conclusion, our results suggest that even 1 cycle of remote IPC immediately before ad hoc PCI attenuates periprocedural cTnI release and reduces the incidence of type 4a MI.",
"Thirty patients with malignant pheochromocytoma (PHEO) or paraganglioma (PGL) were treated with high-dose 131I-MIBG. Patients were 11-62 (mean 39) years old: 19 patients males and 11 females. Nineteen patients had PGL, three of which were multifocal. Six PGLs were nonsecretory. Eleven patients had PHEO. All 30 patients had prior surgery. Fourteen patients were refractory to prior radiation or chemotherapy before 131I-MIBG. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) were collected and cryopreserved. 131I-MIBG was synthesized on-site, by exchange-labeling 131I with 127I-MIBG in a solid-phase Cu2+-catalyzed exchange reaction. 131I-MIBG was infused over 2 h via a peripheral IV. Doses ranged from 557 mCi to 1185 mCi (7.4 mCi/kg to 18.75 mCi/kg). Median dose was 833 mCi (12.55 mCi/kg). Marrow hypoplasia commenced 3 weeks after 131I-MIBG therapy. After the first 131I-MIBG therapy, 19 patients required platelet transfusions; 19 received GCSF; 12 received epoeitin or RBCs. Four patients received a PBSC infusion. High-dose 131I-MIBG resulted in the following overall tumor responses in 30 patients: 4 sustained complete remissions (CRs); 15 sustained partial remissions (PRs); 1 sustained stable disease (SD); 5 progressive disease (PD); 5 initial PRs or SD but relapsed to PD. Twenty-three of the 30 patients remain alive; deaths were from PD (5), myelodysplasia (1), and unrelated cause (1). Overall predicted survival at 5 years is 75% (Kaplan Meier estimate).

"Nipradilol (CAS 81486-22-8) is a non-selective beta-blocker with alpha-1 blocking and nitroglycerin-like vasodilating activities. In the present communication, the long-term efficacy and safety of nipradilol were investigated and the efficacy, safety and utility of topical nipradilol and timolol (CAS 91524-16-2) were compared in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. In the long-term study, nipradilol for 1 year (52 weeks) was performed by registration method. 67 out of 68 patients were subjected to analysis and 57 patients (83.8 %) completed 52-week instillation. 0.25 % nipradilol was applied twice daily to patients. As a result, intraocular pressure (IOP) decreased significantly by 4.0 mmHg to 4.8 mmHg compared with the baseline without tachyphylaxis. The incidence of adverse events was 12.5 % at 52 weeks by analysis with Kaplan-Meier life-table method. It showed no significant trend of increase after 3 months. In the multi-centered double-masked comparative randomized study, 0.25 % nipradilol was assigned to 96 patients and 0.5 % timolol to 100 patients. Each patient was instilled nipradilol or timolol twice daily for 8 weeks. IOP significantly decreased by 4.2 mmHg and by 4.7 mmHg at 8 weeks and the incidence of adverse events was 10.5 % and 12.1 % in the nipradilol and timolol group, respectively. No significant between-group difference in IOP reduction or incidence of adverse events was seen.

"The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome contains two large gene families encoding proteins of unknown function, characterized by conserved N-terminal proline and glutamate (PE and PPE) motifs. The presence of a large number of PE/PPE proteins with repetitive domains and evidence of strain variation has given rise to the suggestion that these proteins may play a role in immune evasion via antigenic variation, while emerging data suggests that some family members may play important roles in mycobacterial pathogenesis. In this study, we examined cellular immune responses to a panel of 36 PE/PPE proteins during human and bovine infection. We observed a distinct hierarchy of immune recognition, reflected both in the repertoire of PE/PPE peptide recognition in individual cows and humans and in the magnitude of IFN-Î³ responses elicited by stimulation of sensitized host cells. The pattern of immunodominance was strikingly similar between cattle that had been experimentally infected with Mycobacterium bovis and humans naturally infected with clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. The same pattern was maintained as disease progressed throughout a four-month course of infection in cattle, and between humans with latent as well as active tuberculosis. Detailed analysis of PE/PPE responses at the peptide level suggests that antigenic cross-reactivity amongst related family members is a major determinant in the observed differences in immune hierarchy. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a subset of PE/PPE proteins are major targets of the cellular immune response to tuberculosis, and are recognized at multiple stages of infection and in different disease states. Thus this work identifies a number of novel antigens that could find application in vaccine development, and provides new insights into PE/PPE biology.",

"In addition to headache, migraine is characterized by a series of symptoms that negatively affects the quality of life of patients. Generally, these are represented by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia and osmophobia, with a cumulative percentage of the onset in about 90% of the patients. From this point of view, menstrually related migraine--a particularly difficult-to-treat form of primary headache--is no different from other forms of migraine. Symptomatic treatment should therefore be evaluated not only in terms of headache relief, but also by considering its effect on these migraine-associated symptoms (MAS). Starting from the data collected in a recently completed multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with almotriptan in menstrually related migraine, an analysis of the effect of this drug on the evolution of MAS was performed. Data suggest that almotriptan shows excellent efficacy on MAS in comparison to the placebo, with a significant reduction in the percentages of suffering patients over a 2-h period of time.",

"This multicenter, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was undertaken to compare the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy and safety of topical bimatoprost 0.03% with that of latanoprost 0.005% for the treatment of patients with normal-tension glaucoma. After washout of all ocular hypotensive medications, patients with normal-tension glaucoma (n=60) were randomly assigned to oncedaily bimatoprost 0.03% or latanoprost 0.005% for 3 mo. Diurnal IOP measurements were taken at each study visit. Primary outcome measures consisted of mean change from baseline IOP (8 AM, Noon, 4 PM) and change in visual field. Secondary measures included mean IOP, ophthalmologic examination findings, results of clinical evaluation, and adverse events. Mean change from baseline IOP at each study visit was statistically significant at all diurnal measurements for patients taking bimatoprost and for those taking latanoprost (P<.001). The 8 AM mean change from baseline IOP measurement showed a significant between-group difference (P< or =.033) in favor of bimatoprost at both follow-up visits. After 3 mo of treatment, mean IOP reductions from baseline ranged from 2.8 to 3.8 mm Hg (17.5%-21.6%) with bimatoprost and from 2.1 to 2.6 mm Hg (12.7%-16.2%) with latanoprost. Overall mean reduction in IOP after 3 mo of treatment was 3.4 mm Hg (19.9% rpar; with bimatoprost and 2.3 mm Hg (14.6%) with latanoprost (P=.035). No significant between-group differences were observed in incidence of adverse events, clinical success, or demographic variables. Bimatoprost was found to be more effective than latanoprost in lowering IOP in the patient with normal-tension glaucoma. Both drugs were efficacious and well tolerated.",

"The long-term efficacy and toxicity of hydroxyurea for infants are undefined, and its role in preventing organ dysfunction is unknown. Short-term feasibility of hydroxyurea administration, toxicities, hematologic effects, and effect on spleen function in infants with sickle cell anemia (SCA) were reported (Hydroxyurea Safety and Organ Toxicity [HUSOFT] trial). These infants completing 2 years of hydroxyurea therapy (20 mg/kg/d) were offered study extension with dose escalation to 30 mg/kg/d. Patients were monitored with laboratory tests and biannual imaging studies. Hematologic indices were compared with predicted age-specific values and event rates compared with historic rates. All 21 subjects completing the original trial enrolled in the extension study: median age, 3.4 years old (range, 2.6 to 4.4 years); 12 females; 20 with Hb SS, 1 with Hb S/beta0-thalassemia. Seventeen patients completed 4 years of hydroxyurea, and 11 completed 6 years. After 4 years, hydroxyurea was associated with increased hemoglobin concentration, percentage of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and decreased reticulocytes, white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (P < .01). Patients experienced 7.5 acute chest syndrome (ACS) events per 100 person-years, compared with 24.5 events per 100 person-years among historic controls (P = .001). Treated patients had better spleen function than expected and improved growth rates. Infants with SCA tolerate prolonged hydroxyurea therapy with sustained hematologic benefits, fewer ACS events, improved growth, and possibly preserved organ function.",

"The Queckenstedt's (Q)-test can aggravate headache intensity during migraine attacks (Q-test effect). The objective of this study was to delineate the Q-test effect in patients experiencing migraine attacks. We performed a 30-s Q- and a sham test on 39 patients with acute migraine attacks in both supine and sitting positions. Headache intensities during and 30 s after the Q- or sham tests were recorded on a 0-10 verbal scale. Brushing allodynia (BA) was recorded after using a gauze-brushing test over the patient's face and forearms. The Q- but not the sham test aggravated headache intensity in both sitting and supine positions. The presence of throbbing pain and higher pain intensities was associated with the Q-test effect in the supine position. However, the presence or absence of BA was not correlated. We concluded that the Q-test effect is likely to be related to peripheral sensitization of the meninges but not central sensitization. The Q-test effect may be used as an objective marker for peripheral sensitization.",
"This study evaluated the efficacy of hydroxyurea treatment in the prevention of vaso-occlusive crises among children and teenagers with severe sickle cell anemia and sickle cell beta-thalassemia. Nineteen children and young adults with severe sickle cell disease were enrolled to the hydroxyurea treatment trial. The incidence of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, hemolytic crises, splenic sequestration episodes, blood transfusions, and hospital days in the 2 years before hydroxyurea (HU) treatment were compared with the same parameters in the first 2 years of treatment. The patients received a mean dose of 21.3 mg/kg/day daily and were treated during a mean period of 40.3 +/- 14 months (range 20 to 68 months). Significant increases were observed after 1 month in the Hgb, MCV, MCH, and MCHC levels and were more notable after 3 months. The increase in the Hgb F level became important after 3 months of HU therapy and was highly significant (p < .001) beyond 6 months. No differences were observed in the RDW, reticulocyte count, Hgb S, and Hgb A2. Severe neutropenia was observed in one case. A decrease in the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, acute chest syndrome, hemolytic crises, blood transfusions, and days spent in the hospital was demonstrated during the HU treatment period compared to the same period before. The clinical and laboratory response to HU was dramatic in severely affected sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients. The response to HU in children and teenagers with severe sickle cell anemia is similar to the response in adults, and no severe adverse effects were observed.",

"In patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), increase of naive T-cell production, as measured by T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs), is an indicator of immune reconstitution. Our objective was to assess whether treating opportunistic infections (OIs) prior to HAART initiation affects CD4 T-cells recovery and TRECs in patients on HAART. HIV-infected patients presenting no OIs or treated OIs were prospectively enrolled prior to HAART initiation and followed-up over 12 months of HAART. CD4 T-cells and TRECs were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months HAART and compared between patients presenting no OIs and those with treated OIs. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify potential factors associated with low TREC increase after 12 months HAART. Forty-four HIV-infected patients, 31 presenting no OIs and 13 with treated OIs at HAART initiation were enrolled. Patients presenting no OIs tended to have higher CD4 T-cell gain than those with treated OIs (151 vs 89 cells/Î¼L; p = 0.05) after 6 months HAART but not after 12 months HAART (120 vs 149 cells/Î¼L; p = 0.84). Among patients presenting no OIs, TREC levels significantly increased from baseline through 12 months HAART while among those with treated OIs, there was a trend for increase only after 12 months. Our study indicates that treatment of OIs prior to HAART does not lead to impaired CD4 T-cells recovery and thymic outputs.",

A study was conducted in Amsterdam in 2000/2001 with the objective to explore the effects of the combination NTX (25/50-mg dd.), NRT, and CRA in terms of craving and abstinence. In a randomized open label, 2 x 2 between subjects design, 25 recovered spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) participants received 8 weeks of treatment. Due to side effects, only 3 participants were compliant in the 50-mg NTX condition. Craving significantly declined between each measurement and there was a significant interaction between decline in craving and craving measured at baseline.

"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of brimonidine 0.2% and dorzolamide 2% on the ocular blood flow velocity in patients with newly diagnosed primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Forty-four (44) patients with newly diagnosed POAG were included in a prospective, comparative, randomized clinical study. Twenty-six (26) healthy volunteers, whose age and gender matched, were recruited to compare the baseline hemodynamic characteristics of the patients. After a complete eye examination, baseline blood flow velocity measurements of the retrobulbar vessels were made with color Doppler ultrasonography. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either brimonidine 0.2% or dorzolamide 2% for a 3-month period. Blood flow velocity measurements were repeated after 3 months. Both brimonidine and dorzolamide significantly reduced the intraocular pressure. The baseline ophthalmic artery pulsatility index was higher in patients with POAG than control subjects. Whereas there was a significant increase in peak systolic velocity of the central retinal artery, no significant change was observed in the other vessels with brimonidine and dorzolamide treatment. There was little difference, in terms of ocular blood flow velocity, between newly diagnosed glaucoma patients and control subjects. Both topical brimonidine and dorzolamide significantly reduced the intraocular pressure without altering ocular blood flow velocity in patients with newly diagnosed POAG.",

"Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is the primary cause of hospitalization of patients with sickle-cell disease. Treatment mainly consists of intravenous morphine, which has many dose-related side effects. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs have been proposed to provide pain relief and decrease the need for opioids. Nevertheless, only a few underpowered trials of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for sickle-cell VOC have been conducted, and conflicting results were reported. We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with ketoprofen (300 mg/day for 5 days), a nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitor, for severe VOC in adults. A total of 66 VOC episodes were included. The primary efficacy outcome was VOC duration. The secondary end points were morphine consumption, pain relief, and treatment failure. Seven VOC episodes in each group were excluded from the analysis because of treatment failures. No significant between-group differences were observed for the primary outcome or the secondary end points. Thus, although ketoprofen was well-tolerated, it had no significant efficacy as treatment of VOC requiring hospitalization. These findings argue against its systematic use in this setting.",

"T-cell immune responses modulated by T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 3 (Tim-3) during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in humans remain poorly understood. Here, we found that active TB patients exhibited increases in numbers of Tim-3-expressing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, which preferentially displayed polarized effector memory phenotypes. Consistent with effector phenotypes, Tim-3(+)CD4(+) and Tim-3(+)CD8(+) T-cell subsets showed greater effector functions for producing Th1/Th22 cytokines and CTL effector molecules than Tim-3(-) counterparts, and Tim-3-expressing T cells more apparently limited intracellular Mtb replication in macrophages. The increased effector functions for Tim-3-expressing T cells consisted with cellular activation signaling as Tim-3(+)CD4(+) and Tim-3(+)CD8(+) T-cell subsets expressed much higher levels of phosphorylated signaling molecules p38, stat3, stat5, and Erk1/2 than Tim-3- controls. Mechanistic experiments showed that siRNA silencing of Tim-3 or soluble Tim-3 treatment interfering with membrane Tim-3-ligand interaction reduced de novo production of IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± by Tim-3-expressing T cells. Furthermore, stimulation of Tim-3 signaling pathways by antibody cross-linking of membrane Tim-3 augmented effector function of IFN-Î³ production by CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, suggesting that Tim-3 signaling helped to drive stronger effector functions in active TB patients. This study therefore uncovered a previously unknown mechanism for T-cell immune responses regulated by Tim-3, and findings may have implications for potential immune intervention in TB.",
"The objective of this article is to evaluate the efficacy of Doxazosin Mesylate Controlled Release Tablets for preoperative treatment of patients with pheochromocytoma. Between 2003 and 2008, 67 patients with confirmed diagnoses of pheochromocytoma were enrolled in this study. According to the drug used in preoperative management, patients were divided into two groups: Doxazosin Mesylate pretreatment group (n=36) and Phenoxybenzamine pretreatment group (n=31). Surgery was performed only in patients who met the optimal preoperative condition. The hematocrit decreased significantly (P<0.001) after antiadrenergic therapy in patients pretreated with phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin. There was no significant difference between the fluid intakes during operation in both groups. The systolic arterial pressures both before and after induction of anesthesia were all significantly higher in the doxazosin patients than in the phenoxybenzamine group (P<0.05). After tumor removed, the lowest systolic arterial pressure was significantly higher in doxazosin group than in phenoxybenzamine group (P<0.05). The fluctuation of systolic arterial pressure during operation was more stable in doxazosin group than in phenoxybenzamine group (P<0.05). Doxazosin mesylate controlled release tablet was as effective as phenoxybenzamine in preoperative volume expansion. Although phenoxybenzamine provided better arterial pressure control, patients pretreated with DOX experienced more stable perioperative hemodynamic changes, shorter preoperative management periods and more simple medication.",

"Inhibitors of carboanhydrase (ICA) in the form of dorzolamide 2% drops and brinzolamide 1% drops are in use for 8-10 years, with a significant intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect. The goal of the present study was to obtain precise data on the efficacy of local ICA in conjunction with timolol 0.5% drops, and to evaluate the incidence of side effects. This was a prospective study that lasted 2 years and included 110 patients. Initial IOP values, before therapy with ICA, amounted to 19 +/- 8.4 mm Hg in group A and 20.5 +/- mm Hg in group B. Although the results obtained demonstrated statistically significant lowering of IOP (in group A by 4.5 +/- 2.4 mm Hg, and in group B by 4.6 +/- 2.1 mm Hg) after therapy with ICA, the difference between the groups was not found. Dorzolamide more frequently caused local side effects like aching, itching and pain in the eye. Aditional lowering of lOP in our patients was somewhat greater than reported before (4.6:4.3). Side effects (itching, aching, pain) were three times more frequent in the group treated with dorzolamide than reported by other authors; this difference could be due to patient age, as our patients were mostly elderly people and the data are subjective. The results of this study suggested the effectiveness of additional local therapy with ICA in patients with open angle glaucoma.",

"Spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) affects only a subset of patients in a variety of disorders. This multi-institutional study attempted to identify unique clinicopathologic features of spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) in a large cohort. A total of 111 cases from 109 patients were retrieved from 3 institutions over an 11-year period: 27 women, 82 men. 66 were smokers, 16 were non-smokers, 27 unknown. Sixty-six cases (61%) had identifiable disorders (secondary SP). Seven patients had a family history of lung disease: 2 of pneumothorax, 2 of lung cancer, and 1 each of emphysema, COPD, and not further classified. Forty-three cases (32 men, 11 women) were primary. The average age was 28 (men) and 37 (women). 17 smoked, 14 were non-smokers, and 12 unknown. In 26%, a unique recently described entity, pneumothorax-associated fibroblastic lesion (PAFL), was noted. 16% of this subset also had cellular alveolar septae. Abundant intraalveolar macrophages were noted in 12 cases. Five cases of unknown etiology had extensive bullous lung disease not otherwise classified.

"Although surgical removal is the therapy of choice in patients with pheochromocytoma, medical management is necessary in the preoperative preparation of these patients and in inoperable cases. An alpha-adrenoceptor-blocking agent is routinely used as initial therapy to control hypertension, with a beta-blocker used as a second-step agent to control tachycardia when indicated. Doxazosin, a selective alpha 1-inhibitor used as an antihypertensive agent for the reduction of coronary heart disease risk in hypertensive patients, appears to be a good agent to control blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate. The aim of this study was to assess the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of doxazosin when used alone or in conjunction with a beta-blocker in 24 patients with pheochromocytoma. Overall excellent or good antihypertensive efficacy was assessed by physicians in 19 of 24 patients (79.2%) enrolled in the study. Doxazosin monotherapy was effective in eight of 12 patients (66.7%), and combined therapy with a beta-blocker was effective in 11 of 12 patients (91.7%). The mean pulse rate remained constant throughout therapy. Adverse reactions were minor and transient and occurred in only three patients. Urinary and plasma catecholamine levels tended to decrease or remained unchanged during doxazosin therapy. There were no clinically hazardous abnormalities or problems in hematologic and biochemical laboratory data. Overall, doxazosin was considered very useful or useful in 83.3% of patients. In conclusion, doxazosin appears to be an excellent agent for the management of hypertension associated with pheochromocytoma.",

"A cross-sectional study was used to compare the "QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube" assay (QFT-GIT) to the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) as a test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) infection among healthcare workers in Auckland, New Zealand (NZ). New employees who underwent pre-employment interviews between 1 May 2007 and 18 March 2008 were recruited. Participants completed a detailed questionnaire to assess their risk of TB. All participants were tested by the QFT-GIT and TST. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to correlate positive results with risk factors for TB and previous BCG. None of the 325 participants were found to have active TB. Approximately 67% had been BCG vaccinated. Positive results for each test were associated with residence in a high incidence country [odds ratio (OR)=6.77; p=0.0005 and 4.48; p<0.0001 for QFT-GIT and TST respectively]. Although positive TST results were associated with "high-risk occupational exposure" to TB [OR=4.13; p=0.016], they were also associated with previous BCG vaccination (OR=5.10; p=0.003). Both tests were associated with at least one well described risk factor for TB infection. The association between positive TST and BCG implies that a high percentage of positive TST results occurred due to non-specific cross-reactivity with BCG. Our findings suggest that among low TB prevalence populations with a high rate of BCG vaccination, the QFT-GIT is more specific than the TST although the superior specificity may be at the expense of some sensitivity.",

"Approximately 2 billion persons worldwide are infected with schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STH), many in areas where endemic malaria transmission coexists. Few data exist on associations between these infections. Nested within a larger clinical trial, primigravid and secundigravid women provided blood samples for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and peripheral malaria films and stool and urine for evaluation of STH and Schistosoma spp. during their initial antenatal clinic visit. The most common parasitic infections were malaria (37.6%), S. haematobium (32.3%), and hookworm (14.4%); 14.2% of women were HIV-infected. S. haematobium infection was associated with lower malarial parasite densities (344 versus 557 parasites/Î¼L blood; P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, HIV and hookworm infection were independently associated with malaria infection (adjusted odds ratio = 1.9 and 95% confidence interval = 1.2-3.0 for HIV; adjusted odds ratio = 1.9 and 95% confidence interval = 1.03-3.5 for hookworm).

"The induction of cellular immunity, in conjunction with antibodies, may be essential for vaccines to protect against blood-stage infection with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. We have shown that prime-boost delivery of P. falciparum blood-stage antigens by chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) followed by the attenuated orthopoxvirus MVA is safe and immunogenic in healthy adults. Here, we report on vaccine efficacy against controlled human malaria infection delivered by mosquito bites. The blood-stage malaria vaccines were administered alone, or together (MSP1+AMA1), or with a pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine candidate (MSP1+ME-TRAP). In this first human use of coadministered ChAd63-MVA regimes, we demonstrate immune interference whereby responses against merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) are dominant over apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) and ME-TRAP. We also show that induction of strong cellular immunity against MSP1 and AMA1 is safe, but does not impact on parasite growth rates in the blood. In a subset of vaccinated volunteers, a delay in time to diagnosis was observed and sterilizing protection was observed in one volunteer coimmunized with MSP1+AMA1-results consistent with vaccine-induced pre-erythrocytic, rather than blood-stage, immunity. These data call into question the utility of T cell-inducing blood-stage malaria vaccines and suggest that the focus should remain on high-titer antibody induction against susceptible antigen targets.",

"Dronedarone is a multi-channel-blocking drug for the treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) with rate- and rhythm-controlling properties. A Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Parallel Arm Trial to Assess the Efficacy of Dronedarone 400 mg b.i.d. for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Hospitalization or Death from Any Cause in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation/Atrial Flutter (ATHENA) demonstrated that dronedarone reduced the risk for first cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause. The aim of this post hoc analysis was to evaluate the rhythm- and rate-controlling properties of dronedarone in the ATHENA trial. Patients were randomized to dronedarone 400 mg twice daily (n = 2,301) or placebo (n = 2,327). Electrocardiographic tracings were classified for AF or AFL or sinus rhythm. Patients with AF or AFL on every postbaseline electrocardiogram were classified as having permanent AF or AFL. All electrical cardioversions were documented. The use of rate-controlling medications was equally distributed in the 2 treatment groups. The median time to first AF or AFL recurrence of patients in sinus rhythm at baseline was 498 days in placebo patients and 737 days in dronedarone patients (hazard ratio 0.749, 95% confidence interval 0.681 to 0.824, p <0.001). In the dronedarone group, 339 patients (15%) had â¥1 electrical cardioversion, compared to 481 (21%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.684, 95% confidence interval 0.596 to 0.786, p <0.001). The likelihood of permanent AF or AFL was lower with dronedarone (178 patients [7.6%]) compared to placebo (295 patients [12.8%]) (p <0.001). At the time of first AF or AFL recurrence, the mean heart rates were 85.3 and 95.5 beats/min in the dronedarone and placebo groups, respectively (p <0.001). In conclusion, dronedarone demonstrated both rhythm- and rate-controlling properties in ATHENA. These effects are likely to contribute to the reduction of important clinical outcomes observed in this trial.",

The secondary hypothesis was to determine to what extent constructs of the TPB predict intentions. 216 adolescents were recruited, 127 randomly allocated to the treatment group (AOL) and 89 to the control group (POL). The subjects completed a TPB questionnaire pre and post intervention. Both POL and AOL groups showed significant improvements from pretest to posttest survey. However, the results indicated no significant difference between POL and AOL for all constructs except behavioral belief. Correlational analysis indicated that all TPB constructs were significantly correlated with intentions for pretest and posttest for both groups. Attitude and behavioral control showed strongest correlations. Regression analysis indicated that TPB constructs were predictive of intentions and the predictive power improved post intervention. Behavioral control consistently predicted intentions for all categories and was the strongest predictor for pretest scores. For posttest scores, knowledge and attitude were the strongest predictors for POL and AOL groups respectively. Thus, HOT project improved knowledge and the TPB constructs scores for targeted behaviors, healthy eating and physical activity, for prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

"The efficacy ofreamberin, remaxol, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (ademethionine) and 5% glucose solution was estimated in the treatment of patients with tuberculosis of the respiratory organs and drug hepatotoxicity signs confirmed by higher activity of liver indicative enzymes and nitrogen oxide levels. Remaxol showed a pronounced positive effect on the cytolytic syndrome signs, evident from lower activity of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. At the same time ademethionine was superior to remaxol in the effect on the cholestatic signs and inferior in the effect on the cytolytic signs. By the effect on the activity of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, reamberin was inferior to remaxol and superior to ademe-thionine, its effect on the cholestasis markers level vs. the other drugs being superior only to that of 5% glucose solution. As compared to reamberin, ademethionine and 5% glucose solution, remaxol promoted higher integral indices of the host antioxidant protection (total antioxidant capacity and total antioxidant status), that partially explained the drug pronounced hepatoprotective effect.",

In the GP, the frequency of migraine (percentage and 95% confidence interval) was 14.9 (11.8-17.9). The migraine frequencies were (percentage and odd ratio probability against the GP: bipolar disorder (15.7%, p = 0.5), schizophrenia (8.3%, p = 0.08), depression and dysthimia (24.4%, p = 0.2), anxiety disorders (10.0%, p = 0.02), personality disorders (11.4%, p = 0.15), all other disorders (15.5%, p = 0.4), relatives of bipolar patients (4.4%, p < 0.001), relatives of schizophrenia patients (3.5%, p = 0.003), and relatives of patients with all other mental disorders (12.8%, p = 0.4).

A high variability was observed in migraine prevalence among the diagnostic categories, but it was particularly high in subjects with affective disorders, mainly in women, who thus deserve special attention from clinicians.",
"Sickle-cell anemia is one of the most prevalent hereditary disorders with prominent morbidity and mortality. Oxidative phenomena play a significant role in the disorder's pathophysiology. A forumlation of garlic (Allium sativum), AGE, has been reported to exert an antioxidant effect in vitro. We evaluated the antioxidant effect of AGE on sickle red blood cells (RBCs). Five patients (two men and three women, mean age 40+/-15 years, range 24-58 years) with sickle-cell anemia participated in the study. AGE was administered at a dose of 5 mL daily. Whole blood samples were obtained at baseline and at 4 wk, primarily for Heinz body analysis. In all patients, the number of Heinz bodies decreased over the 4-wk period (58.9+/-20.0% at baseline to 29.8+/-15.3% at follow-up; P=0.03). These data suggest that AGE has a significant antioxidant activity on sickle RBCs. AGE may be further evaluated as a potential therapeutic agent to ameliorate complications of sickle-cell anemia.",

All of these patients were treated by endoscopic resection of the bullae (or apical zone in cases where the suspected abnormalities, or bullae, could not be visualized) plus physical pleurodesis. There were no perioperative deaths. Complications occurred in 6% of the cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax and in 45% of the cases of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. The complications among the secondary pneumothorax patients ranged widely from postoperative subcutaneous emphysema (resolved through simple, unassisted observation) to the need for an accessory minithoracotomy.

Full ocular examination and spirometric testing were performed; a questionnaire concerned with ocular symptoms was completed, and pulse rate was recorded. Two months later, mean IOP was similar with the combination (17.2 mm Hg) and with bimatoprost (16.4 mm Hg), but mean peak expiratory flow rate, ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity, and heart rate had increased significantly after the switch was made to bimatoprost.

"In five healthy selected volunteers with normal blood pressure and one pheochromocytoma patient, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been evaluated, with electrochemical detection for quantitation of urinary catecholamines and metanephrines during administration of the antihypertensive, alpha-methyldopa. The clinical usefulness of HPLC is compared with that of the conventional assay method--the trihydroxyindole (THI)-fluorometric procedure. The THI fluorometric method is known to suffer from true false-positive interference as a result of its inability to differentiate between alpha-methyldopa, its primary metabolic derivatives, and the structurally similar endogenous catecholamines. It is shown that the HPLC separation methodology yields accurate, reproducible results devoid of interference from the presence of alpha-methyldopa. Free urinary excretion rates of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine were elevated by alpha-methyldopa, P less than 0.001, for epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine when measured by the trihydroxyindole technique but not with high performance liquid chromatography. With alpha-methyldopa treatment, urinary normetanephrine excretion rates were slightly increased, P less than 0.05, by fluorometric analysis and slightly decreased. P less than 0.05, when measured by HPLC. Of added interest, the formation of the normetanephrine analog of alpha-methyldopa, previously undetected, is suggested. Slightly elevated metanephrine levels are seen by the THI-fluorometric method in the presence of alpha-methyl metanephrines. Establishing that the HPLC assay procedure is suitable for clinical diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, despite the presence of alpha-methyldopa, makes it unnecessary to discontinue use of this antihypertensive in screening for pheochromocytoma.",

"The CRUCIAL trial was designed to compare the relative reduction in calculated Framingham coronary heart disease risk when a multiple risk factor intervention strategy, based on single-pill amlodipine besylate/atorvastatin calcium, was compared with a usual-care strategy. Eligible patients had treated or untreated hypertension, >or=3 additional cardiovascular risk factors, and baseline total cholesterol<or=6.5 mmol/L, but no coronary heart disease. The CRUCIAL trial was a 12-month, international, multicenter, prospective, stratified, cluster-randomized, parallel-design, open-label trial conducted in 20 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America. We anticipate the results of this study will be available in mid to late 2010. In this article we report the rationale for and design of the CRUCIAL trial and discuss how the challenges in the design and conduct of this cluster-randomized trial were addressed. The cluster-randomized trial design, with the investigator as the unit of randomization, was chosen to minimize contamination between the trial arms. The intent of the study was to compare the new therapeutic strategy with customary treatment practices, so no recommendation was made regarding the choice of antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs in the usual-care arm. It was considered that if the investigator managed both arms of the trial it would be difficult to prevent crossover of treatment strategies. Patients were enrolled in the study before the investigators were randomized to avoid selection bias. Investigators were randomized in a 1:1 ratio within each country to explicitly balance the treatment arms with respect to potential confounding factors. The cluster effect was taken into account in the sample size calculation. The findings from the CRUCIAL trial have the potential to inform current thinking on how to effectively reduce the cardiovascular risk of patients with hypertension and additional risk factors but only modestly elevated total cholesterol.",

"Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disorder of unknown cause characterized by peribronchial, perivascular, and perilymphatic proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle cells leading to cystic lesions. The hypothesis of hormonal dependence and the effectiveness of hormonal therapy have not yet been demonstrated conclusively, and the prevalence of extrathoracic manifestations and the survival of patients with LAM are somewhat contradictory. A multicentric retrospective study was conducted in an attempt to describe better the initial features, the diagnostic procedures, the associated lesions, and, above all, the management and course of LAM in a large homogeneous series of 69 stringently selected patients, with a majority of cases diagnosed since 1990. The aim of the study, based on a review of the literature, also was to provide a comprehensive view of this uncommon disease. The clinical features were in keeping with previous studies, but we found that exertional dyspnea and pneumothorax were the most common features, and chylous involvement was less frequent. LAM was diagnosed after menopause in about 10% of cases. The onset of LAM occurred during pregnancy in 20% of cases, and a clear exacerbation of LAM was observed in 14% of cases during pregnancy. Pulmonary LAM was diagnosed on lung histopathology in 83% of cases, but renal angiomyolipoma, observed in 32% of our patients, may be a useful diagnostic criterion when associated with typical multiple cysts on chest CT scan or with chylous effusion. Chest CT scan was more informative than chest X-ray (normal in 9% of cases), and may be indicated in spontaneous pneumothorax or renal angiomyolipoma in women of childbearing age. About 40% of the patients had a normal initial spirometry, while an obstructive ventilatory defect (44%), a restrictive ventilatory defect (23%), was observed in other patients. Initial diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was frequently decreased (82%). Hormonal therapy was administered in 57 patients, but a clear > or = 15% improvement of FEV1 was observed in only 4 evaluable patients, treated with tamoxifen and progestogens (n = 2), progestogen (n = 1), and oophorectomy (n = 1). Probably 1 of the most urgent needs for clinical research in LAM is to test the currently available hormonal treatments in the context of international multicenter prospective controlled studies. Pleurodesis was performed in 40 patients. Lung transplantation was performed in 13 patients, 7.8 +/- 5.2 years after onset of LAM, in whom the mean FEV1 was 0.57 +/- 0.15 L. After a follow-up of 2.3 +/- 2.2 years, 9 patients were alive. Mean follow-up from onset of disease to either death or closing date was 8.2 +/- 6.3 years. Overall survival was better than usually reported in LAM, and Kaplan-Meier plot showed survival probabilities of 91% after 5 years, 79% after 10 years, and 71% after 15 years of disease duration.",
"We hypothesised that relaxation of the serratus anterior muscle by long thoracic nerve (LTN) block could help pain relief after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Patients undergoing thoracoscopic wedge resection for pneumothorax were randomly assigned to control or LTN block. LTN block was performed before induction of general anaesthesia. Pain was evaluated using a visual analogue scale before anaesthesia induction (T0), on arrival to the post-anaesthetic care unit (PACU) (T1), every ten minutes after arrival in the PACU for 30 minutes (T2, T3 and T4) and one hour and 24 hours after discharge from the PACU (T5 and T6). Visual analogue scale scores from T1 to T5 in the block group were lower than the control group (T1: 36Â±11 vs 48Â±14 [P=0001], T2: 36Â±11 vs 51Â±15 [P<0.001], T3: 35Â±vs 52Â±15 [P<0.001], T4: 30Â±7 vs 45Â±17 [P<0.001] and T5: 26Â±5 vs 32Â±5 [P<0.001]). Total intravenous patient-controlled analgesia bolus dose (alfentanil 75 Âµg/ml) during PACU stay (1.6Â±1.2 vs 3.9Â±2.0 ml, P<0.001) and one hour after discharge from the PACU (0.5Â±0.8 vs 1.7Â±1.2 ml, P<0.001) in the LTN group was significantly lower than the control group. Total intravenous patient-controlled analgesia bolus dose from 1-24 hours after discharge from the PACU was similar between groups (P=0197). These findings indicate that LTN block reduced pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery from end-of-surgery to one hour after discharge from the PACU.",

"Although some data suggest that statins can improve cardiac mechanical function in some patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), the effects of long-term statin therapy on cardiac electrical instability remain unclear. We performed a randomized perspective analysis of the effects of 10 mg/d (statin group 1, n=40), 20 mg/d (statin group 2, n=38) of atorvastatin and controls (control group, n=41) on corrected QT intervals (QTc), corrected QT dispersion (QTcd) and cardiac function in patients with CHF secondary to coronary artery disease (CAD) for one year. At 6 and 12 months, the statin groups displayed lower QTc and QTcd compared with controls. The changes were becoming more distinct in statin group 2, (P<0.05). In statin groups, the changes of QTc and QTcd were independent of changes of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol levels, and the decrease of QTcd was correlated with the increase of LVEF within 12 months. Atorvastatin shortens QTc, QTcd and improves cardiac function, and might thereby be parts of the mechanisms which atorvastatin benefited CHF patients secondary to CAD.",

"Lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) decreases mortality in select patient populations. LLT has also been shown to have antiarrhythmic effects, thus favorably influencing the incidence and recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, data are lacking regarding the effect of LLT on mortality in patients with AF. The Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) study was the one of the largest multicenter trials comprising of 4,060 patients with AF at high risk for stroke and death. This is a post hoc analysis of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute limited-access dataset of AFFIRM patients who were on LLT at the time of randomization (n = 913). The control group consisted of AFFIRM patients who were not on LLT (n = 3,147). Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed controlling for baseline differences. The end point was all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and ischemic stroke. A separate analysis was carried out for the combined end point of death, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, major bleeding, systemic embolism, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction. Patients on LLT were younger and on more cardioactive medications but also had more cardiovascular morbidities. On multivariate analysis, LLT use was associated with lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62 to 0.95, p = 0.01), cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.95, p = 0.02), ischemic stroke (HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.89, p = 0.01), and combined end point (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.96, p = 0.01). In conclusion, a decrease in mortality and adverse cardiovascular events was observed using LLT in AF.",

"We examined the effects of regular bedside testing of pulmonary mechanics (PM) on the outcome of 468 acutely ill, mechanically ventilated neonates. During the first of two 18-month study periods, 217 infants were mechanically ventilated without the assistance of PM measurements. During the second 18-month period, 251 infants were ventilated with the assistance of at least daily PM measurements. Using data obtained from the PM tests, we adjusted the infants' ventilators to maintain tidal volume, inspiratory time, and pressure-volume loops within predetermined limits. With the exception of the PM measurements, given the limitations of retrospective analyses, both groups of infants received identical medical and nursing care. The infants ventilated with the assistance of PM testing developed fewer pneumothoraces (4.0%; 10/251) vs. no PM testing, 10.1% (22/217); P < 0.05 by Chi-square analysis]. Infants weighing less than 1,500 g ventilated with the assistance of PM measurements had less intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) overall, most notably, less grades I and II IVH (total IVH-PM testing, 39.1% vs. no PM testing, 65.7%; P < 0.01; Grades I-II IVH-PM testing, 30.4% vs. no PM testing, 54.9%; P < 0.01). IVH incidence was decreased independent of pneumothorax occurrence. Survival rates, incidences of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and durations of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization were similar. This retrospective analysis suggests that PM testing during infant mechanical ventilation reduces common acute ventilator-associated complications.",

"With the launch of the fixed combination of travoprost 0.004%/timolol 0.5% (trav/tim) in Germany in May 2006, a noninterventional observational study designed as an open-label, multicenter, 6-week trial was initiated in order to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of this new drug combination in glaucoma patients. Participants were grouped into categories according to previous drug regimens: those on timolol monotherapy; those on prostaglandin analog (PGA) monotherapy; those on concomitant therapy with a PGA and timolol; and those on fixed combinations. Trav/tim was well accepted by the patients, with 87.9% judging the tolerability of the therapy as good, very good, or excellent. Analysis of intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements showed statistically significant IOP decreases in all four categories examined in our study after regimen substitution with fixed-combination trav/tim. Fixed-combination prostaglandin analog/beta-blocker formulations are an attractive therapeutic option due to their strong IOP-lowering efficacy with once-daily dosing. In this study, glaucoma patients who underwent a regimen modification to fixed-combination trav/tim showed further reductions in IOP, irrespective of which selected monoor multiple therapies had been used previously.",

"Previously, we demonstrated that there is an increased utilization of glutamine by intact sickle red blood cells (RBC) in conjunction with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism in vitro. In this report, we describe the in vivo effect of L-glutamine supplementation on total NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH), and NAD redox potential of sickle RBC. Seven adult sickle cell anemia patients participated in this study. The exclusion criteria were pregnancy, previous or current use of hydroxyurea, and transfusion within 3 months of initiation of the study. After proper consent, L-glutamine was started at a dose of 30 g/day administered orally. Fasting blood samples were drawn at baseline and after 4 weeks of therapy by routine phlebotomy for evaluation of RBC total NAD and NADH levels. We found significant changes in both the NADH level and NAD redox potential (ratio of NADH to NAD+ + NADH). NAD redox potential increased from 47.2 +/- 3.7% to 62.1 +/- 11.8% (P < 0.01). The NADH level increased from 47.5 +/- 6.3 to 72.1 +/- 15.1 nmol/ml RBC (P < 0.01). The total NAD level demonstrated an upward trend (from 101.2 +/- 16 to 116.4 +/- 14.7 nmol/ml RBC) but this was not statistically significant. Our data show that oral L-glutamine can significantly increase the NAD redox potential and NADH level in sickle RBC. These changes may decrease oxidative susceptibility of sickle RBC and result in clinical benefit.",
"Adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) agonists reduce invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell activation and decrease inflammation in sickle cell disease (SCD) mice. We conducted a phase 1 trial of the A2AR agonist regadenoson in adults with SCD. The target dose was 1.44 Î¼g/kg/h. iNKT cell activation was evaluated using antibodies targeting the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-ÎºB (phospho-NF-ÎºB p65), interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), and A2AR. Regadenoson was administered to 27 adults with SCD. We examined 21 patients at steady state and 6 during painful vaso-occlusive crises (pVOC). iNKT cell activation was also measured in 14 African-American controls. During pVOC, the fraction of iNKT cells demonstrating increased phospho-NF-ÎºB p65 and A2AR expression was significantly higher compared with controls (P < .01) and steady-state patients (P < .05). IFN-Î³ expression was also significantly higher compared with controls (P = .02). After a 24-hour infusion of regadenoson during pVOC, phospho-NF-ÎºB p65 activation in iNKT cells decreased compared to baseline by a median of 48% (P = .03) to levels similar to controls and steady-state SCD.

Propensity score for warfarin use, estimated for each of the 2,248 patients, was used to match 227 of the 347 patients not on warfarin (in 1:1, 1:2, or 1:3 sets) to 616 patients on warfarin who were balanced in 45 baseline characteristics. All-cause mortality occurred in 18% and 33% of matched patients receiving and not receiving warfarin, respectively, during up to 6 years (mean 3.4) of follow-up (hazard ratio [HR] when warfarin use was compared to its nonuse 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43 to 0.77, p <0.001).

"The use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors (GPIs) in high-risk patients with acute coronary syndromes has been associated with reductions in ischemic events but increases in bleeding complications. The role of GPIs in patients who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by the transradial approach (TRA) is not well studied. The aim of this post hoc analysis from the randomized prospective Acute Myocardial Infarction Treated With Primary Angioplasty and Intravenous Enoxaparin or Unfractionated Heparin to Lower Ischemic and Bleeding Events at Short- and Long-Term Follow-Up (ATOLL) trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of GPIs in primary PCI performed using the TRA. A total of 910 patients were enrolled in ATOLL; 522 patients (67%) underwent PCI using the TRA. Two comparative analyses were performed. First, patients who underwent PCI using the TRA who received GPIs were compared with those who did not receive GPIs. Second, patients who underwent PCI using the TRA who received GPIs were compared with those who underwent PCI using a nonradial route and received GPIs. Composite end points of net clinical benefit, ischemic outcomes, and safety consisting of bleeding and transfusion at 1 month were analyzed. A propensity score was constructed, and weight adjustment were made for variables, including but not limited to age, weight, gender, renal function, concomitant use of other medications, Killip class, and medical history, when analyzing the end points. There was no significant difference in net clinical benefit or ischemic outcomes between either TRA patients with versus without GPIs or TRA patients with GPIs versus non-TRA patients with GPIs. Additionally, there were significantly fewer major bleeding events and blood transfusions in TRA patients with GPIs compared with non-TRA patients with GPIs. In conclusion, the addition of GPIs in the setting of primary PCI using the TRA was not associated with bleeding liability. The use of GPIs with TRA was associated with safer outcomes than using GPIs with a nontransradial approach. This study was limited in that it was a nonrandomized retrospective analysis.",

"Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been advocated as an effective tool against malaria transmission. However, success of this community based intervention largely depends on the knowledge and practice regarding malaria and its prevention. According to the national strategy plan on evaluation of LLINs (Olyset nets), this study was conducted to determine the perceptions and practices about malaria and to improve use of LLINs in Bashagard district, one of the important foci of malaria in southeast Iran. The study area comprised 14 villages that were randomized in two clusters and designated as LLINs and untreated nets. Each of households in both clusters received two bed nets by the free distribution and delivery. After one month quantitative data collection method was used to collect information regarding the objectives of the study. On the basis of this information, an educational program was carried out in both areas to increase motivation for use of bed nets. Community knowledge and practice regarding malaria and LLIN use assessed pre- and post-educational program. The data were analyzed using SPSS ver.16 software. At baseline, 77.5% of respondents in intervention and 69.4 % in control area mentioned mosquito bite as the cause of malaria, this awareness increased significantly in intervention (90.3%) and control areas (87.9%), following the educational program. A significant increase also was seen in the proportion of households who used LLINs the previous night (92.5%) compared with untreated nets (87.1%). Educational status was an important predictor of LLINs use. Regular use of LLIN was considerably higher than the targeted coverage (80%) which recommended by World Heaths Organization. About 81.1% and 85.3% of respondents from LLIN and control areas reported that mosquito nuisance and subsequent malaria transmission were the main determinants of bed net use. These findings highlight a need for educational intervention in implementation of long-lasting insecticidal nets; this should be considered in planning and decision-making in the national malaria control program during the next campaigns of LLINs in Iran.",

"Since the second edition of the International classification of headache disorders (ICDH-II 2004), chronic migraine has been listed amongst migraine complications. Compared to episodic migraine the prevalence of chronic migraine is low, its impact, however, significant. Until recently no prophylactic drug had been approved for chronic migraine prophylaxis. After case reports had stated an effect of botulinum toxin type A on migraine, several randomized placebo-controlled studies were conducted in episodic headache; the results, however, were disappointing. Only when botulinum toxin type A was used in chronic migraine in the PREEMPT (phase 3 research evaluating migraine prophylaxis therapy) trials, its superiority compared to placebo was established. Thus, for the first time a prophylactic drug against chronic migraine is available which is both effective and well tolerated. BotoxÂ® has been licensed in England for the prophylaxis of headaches in adults with chronic migraine in 2010. Approval for its use in Germany has been applied for.",
"Early beta-blocker use is common in patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, with oral administration being the most prevalent. Oral beta-blockers were associated with a decrease in the risk of cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, and acute heart failure.

"A healthy diet and plant sterols (PS) are recommended for reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and, subsequently, the risk of premature cardiovascular disease. PS mediate a decrease in fat-soluble vitamin concentration, which can lead to a general impairment of antioxidative defenses and an increase in oxidative stress. Thus, we evaluated the effects of a healthy diet, including PS-enriched low-fat milk, on cardiovascular risk and oxidative stress parameters in hypercholesterolemic subjects. This was a randomized parallel trial employing 40 subjects and consisting of two 3-month intervention phases. After 3 months on a standard healthy diet, subjects were divided into two intervention groups: a diet group and a diet+PS group (2 g/day). Lipid profile, apolipoproteins, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and oxidative stress parameters were analyzed. Diet significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol (4.0% and 4.7%, respectively), produced an increase in the level of beta-carotene (23%) and improved the antioxidant capacity of LDL cholesterol particles (4.6%). PS induced a significant decrease in total cholesterol (6.4%), LDL (9.9%) and the apolipoprotein B100/apolipoprotein A1 ratio (4.9%), but led to a decrease in cryptoxanthin level (29%) without any change being observed in the antioxidant capacity of LDL cholesterol particles, total antioxidant status or lipid peroxidation. After 3 months, we observed the positive effect of including a PS supplement in dietary measures, as the lipoprotein-mediated risk of cardiovascular disease was reduced. Despite a decrease in the concentration of cryptoxanthin, no evidence of a global impairment of antioxidative defenses or an enhancement of oxidative stress parameters was found.",
"The genetic bases of the highly variable degrees of anaemia and haemolysis in persons with Hb SS are not fully known, but several studies have indicated that G6PD deficiency is not a factor. The G6PD(202A) and G6PD(376G) alleles and alpha-thalassaemia were determined by molecular genetic testing in 261 children and adolescents with Hb SS in a multicentre study. G6PD(202A,376G) (G6PD A-) was defined as hemizygosity for both alleles in males and homozygosity in females. Among the participants 41% were receiving hydroxycarbamide. The prevalence of G6PD(202A,376G) was 13.6% in males and 3.3% in females with an overall prevalence of 8.7%. G6PD(202A,376G) was associated with a 10 g/l decrease in haemoglobin concentration (P = 0.008) but not with increased haemolysis as measured by lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, aspartate-aminotransferase, reticulocyte count or a haemolytic component derived from these markers (P > 0.09). Similar results were found within a sub-group of children who were not receiving hydroxycarbamide. By comparison, single and double alpha-globin deletions were associated with progressively higher haemoglobin concentrations (P = 0.005 for trend), progressively lower values for haemolytic component (P = 0.007), and increased severe pain episodes (P < 0.001). In conclusion, G6PD(202A,376G) may be associated with lower haemoglobin concentration in sickle cell anaemia by a mechanism other than increased haemolysis.",

"Lymph node tuberculosis (LNTB) is the most frequent form of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Randomised, controlled trials have convincingly demonstrated that 6 months of chemotherapy is sufficient for most drug-susceptible LNTB. We performed a retrospective, multicentric study from 1997 to 2010 to describe factors associated with prolonged anti-tuberculosis treatment in patients with LNTB. Of 126 patients diagnosed with LNTB, 22 (17.5%) were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected. The median treatment duration was 9 months (interquartile range, 6-12). Treatment was significantly longer in patients with HIV (P < 0.01), additional sites of TB (P < 0.01) or weight loss (P = 0.04). Factors independently associated with excessively lengthy treatment were HIV co-infection and the presence of other TB foci.",

"The pre and intraoperative use of calcium channel blockers (CCB) has been suggested for the management of either eutopic or ectopic pheochromocytomas. We report our experience of 70 pheochromocytomas, operated between 1988 and 1996 and managed with CCB, especially nicardipine. 59 were hypertensive (84.2%). Preparation consisted of nicardipine in 61 patients or another CCB in 9 cases with duration ranging from 24 hours to several weeks depending on plasma volume and blood pressure control. Intraoperatively, nicardipine infusion was started after intubation, adjusted according to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and stopped before ligation of the tumor venous drainage. Increases in SBP greater than 200 mmHg were observed in 10 patients and were effectively controlled by nicardipine in all cases. In 16 patients, the S > BP remained less than 150 mmHg throughout anesthesia. Heart rate greater than 100 b p m occureed in 51 patients and was easily controlled with esmolol whenever used (n = 27). Arythmias were unfrequent (n = 4) and required treatment in only one case. This study confirms the ability to adequately manage pheochromocytomas with the use of nicardipine as sole vasodilating agent.",

"Approximately 466,000 West Virginians, or about 25 percent of the state population, have prediabetes and are at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Appropriate lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes if individuals at risk are identified and treated early. The West Virginia Diabetes Prevention and Control Program and the West Virginia University Office of Health Services Research are developing a systematic approach to diabetes prevention within primary care. This study aims to demonstrate the viability of patient registry software for the analysis of disparate electronic health record (EHR) data sets and standardized identification of at-risk patients for early detection and intervention. Preliminary analysis revealed that of 94,283 patients without a documented diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes, 10,673 (11.3 percent) meet one or more of the risk criteria. This study indicates that EHR data can be repurposed into an actionable registry for prevention. This model supports meaningful use of EHRs, the Patient-Centered Medical Home program, and improved care through enhanced data management.",

"It has been demonstrated that alterations of adipocytokines can alter immune status in type 2 diabetes. The present study investigated changes of adipocytokine plasma concentrations and cellular immune status in overweight men, suffering from non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes (n=14, age 61.0Â±8.7 years, BMI 31.1Â±3.5 kg/cm2). Subjects underwent a 3 months endurance exercise intervention (twice per week for up to 45 min) cycling at a heart rate corresponding to a 2 mmol/l lactate threshold. Before and after the intervention testing for adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin) and cellular immune status (including T memory-cells and regulative T-cells) was performed by RIA and FACS accordingly.The exercise intervention improved anthropometric and metabolic parameters of all subjects. We observed a significant decline for resistin and for the CD19+ B-cells. The CD4+CD25+CD127low Treg-cells decreased, however not statistically significant. All other parameters remained unchanged.In conclusion, even though only training twice a week, the exercise affected parts of the cellular immune system as well as resistin levels in men suffering from non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes.",

"The purpose of this study was to determine management guidelines for biopsy-induced pneumothorax with the assistance of manual aspiration, mainly based on the duration of complicated pneumothorax. Data from 388 consecutive percutaneous needle lung biopsies were examined. Patients with pneumothorax on postbiopsy chest CT images underwent percutaneous manual aspiration with an 18-G i.v. catheter. Frequency and management of biopsy-induced pneumothorax and period to its disappearance were reviewed. Postbiopsy pneumothorax occurred in 133 of 388 (34.3%) procedures. Manual aspiration in 72 of these 133 patients was carried out immediately after biopsy. The pneumothorax had resolved completely on follow-up chest radiographs without chest tube placement in 121 of the 133 pneumothoraces (91.0%). In cases requiring chest tube, the mean period from biopsy until resolution of the pneumothorax was 6.0 +/- 5.3 days, but was only 2.4 +/- 2.9 days when chest tube placement was not needed. Specifically, time until recovery was short both in those not requiring manual aspiration (2.1 +/- 3.4 days) and in those with a pneumothorax that disappeared completely or almost completely after manual aspiration (1.9 +/- 2.0 days). The almost equally short recovery periods in patients not requiring manual aspiration and those requiring immediate manual aspiration indicates the value of rapid management.",
"Previous studies investigating prehospital use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction reached conflicting conclusions. The benefit of this strategy in addition to in-ambulance loading of dual-antiplatelet therapy remains controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze data from a prospective registry of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions admitted <24 hours after symptom onset (July 2006 to May 2012). A total of 2,052 patients managed in a physician-staffed mobile intensive care unit (MICU)<12 hours after symptom onset and scheduled for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) were retrospectively included. Patients who received GPIs in the MICU were compared with those who did not. The primary end point was infarct-related artery patency, defined as pre-PPCI Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3. GPIs were administered in the MICU to 737 patients (36%), including 430<2 hours after symptom onset, and 1,315 patients (64%) did not received prehospital GPIs. Pre-PPCI TIMI flow grade 3 rate was lower in patients treated in the MICU (17.2% vs 21.3%, p=0.03) because of patients treated >2 hours after symptom onset, of whom only 12.7% reached the primary end point. There was no significant difference between groups in the rate of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events. In conclusion, prehospital GPI use in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions<12 hours after symptom onset scheduled for PPCI neither improved pre-PPCI infarct-related artery patency nor reduced in-hospital major adverse cardiac events.",

"The effectiveness of tangential fluoroscopic guidance of the anesthetizing needle to avoid transgression of the pleura and therefore lower pneumothorax and chest tube insertion rates after transthoracic needle lung biopsy (TNB) was investigated. Tangential guidance was used in 41 patients (group A) and was not used in 51 (group B). The pneumothorax rate was 39% (16 of 41) for group A and 31% (16 of 51) for group B. The chest tube insertion rate was 12% (five of 41) for group A and 4% (two of 51) for group B. None of the differences in rates were significant. Use of this technique does not lower pneumothorax or chest tube insertion rates in patients undergoing TNB.",

"The Ministry of Health recommended in Benin, since 2004, artemisinin-based combination, artemether-lumtefantrine (CoartemÂ®), therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. To resolve the difficulties related to observance, we are interested in a new combination, artemisinin-naphthoquine (ArcoÂ®). A study was conducted to assess and compare the efficacy and tolerability of the fixed combination artemisinin (125 mg)-naphthoquine (50 mg), a single-dose drug, administered one day versus artemether (20 mg)-lumefantrine (120 mg).The clinical assessment was a single-blinded, two-arm, randomized trial comparing ArcoÂ® combination as a single-dose regimen and three-day regimen of CoartemÂ® for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, from july to october 2008 and may to september 2009, with 28 days of follow-up in children. PCR genotyping was used to classify re-infection or recrudescence. The primary outcome measures for efficacy were cure rates on days 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Secondary outcomes included parasite clearance time and fever clearance time. The main outcome measures for safety were incidences of post-treatment clinical and laboratory adverse events. A total of 174 patients (84 in ArcoÂ® group and 90 in CoartemÂ® group) were evaluated for clinical and parasitological outcomes. The cure rate was 98.8% for ArcoÂ® and 100% for CoartemÂ® on day 28, with no statistically significant difference. Fever clearance was obtained within 24 hours in both groups. The parasite clearance is obtained at 48 hours in ArcoÂ® group and at 60 hours in CoartemÂ® group. Both treatments were well tolerated without major side effects. This study therefore concluded that the combination of artemisinin-naphthoquine is as effective and well tolerated as the combination artemether-lumefantrine in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Benin children. This medication administered in single dose is therapy of choice to reduce compliance problems during malaria treatment and also to facilitate community-based care of malaria.",
"Two case reports are presented of patients who underwent surgical removal of phaeochromocytoma at Goroka Base Hospital, one with the use of thoracic epidural blockade supplemented with light general anaesthesia.

After 16-week treatments, fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin values were comparably reduced in both groups. Changes in target-to-background ratio values from baseline were significantly greater in the pioglitazone group than in the glimepiride group (-0.12 Â± 0.06 vs. 0.09 Â± 0.07, p = 0.032), as well as changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (pioglitazone vs. glimepiride group: median: -0.24 [interquartile range (IQR): -1.58 to -0.04] mg/l vs. 0.08 [IQR: -0.07 to 0.79] mg/l, p = 0.031).",

Death occurred in 2 patients (0.5%) receiving warfarin and 2 patients receiving apixaban (0.6%).",
"Plasma proteins mediate thrombogenesis, inflammation, endocardial injury and structural remodelling in atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesised that anti-coagulation with rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, would differentially modulate biologically-relevant plasma proteins, compared with warfarin, a multi-coagulation protein antagonist. We performed unbiased liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectroscopy and candidate multiplexed protein immunoassays among Japanese subjects with non-valvular chronic AF who were randomly assigned to treatment with 24 weeks of rivaroxaban (n=93) or warfarin (n=94). Nine metaproteins, including fibulin-1 (p=0.0033), vitronectin (p=0.0010), haemoglobin Î± (p=0.0012), apolipoproteins C-II (p=0.0017) and H (p=0.0023), complement C5 precursor (p=0.0026), coagulation factor XIIIA (p=0.0026) and XIIIB (p=0.0032) subunits, and 10 candidate proteins, including thrombomodulin (p=0.0004), intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (p=0.0064), interleukin-8 (p=0.0007) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (p=0.0003), were differentially expressed among patients with and without known clinical risk factors for stroke and bleeding in AF. Compared with warfarin, rivaroxaban treatment was associated with a greater increase in thrombomodulin (Î 0.1 vs. 0.3 pg/ml, p=0.0026) and a trend towards a reduction in matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Î 2.2 vs. -4.9 pg/ml, p=0.0757) over 24 weeks. Only modest correlations were observed between protein levels and prothrombin time, factor Xa activity and prothrombinase-induced clotting time. Plasma proteomics can identify distinct functional patterns of protein expression that report on known stroke and bleeding risk phenotypes in an ethnically-homogeneous AF population. The greater upregulation of thrombomodulin among patients randomised to rivaroxaban represents a proof-of-principle that pharmacoproteomics can be employed to discern novel effects of factor Xa inhibition beyond standard pharmacodynamic measures.",
"Anaemia, the major sequelae of chronic renal disease (CRD) needs to be investigated because it acts as an independent risk factor for worsening of cardiovascular survival, cognitive impairment and poor quality of life. In this prospective tertiary care hospital-based study we have followed up 100 randomly assigned CRD patients who were not on dialysis for at least 6 months. Left ventricular mass index (LVMI), ejection fraction (EF), mini-mental status examination (MMSE) and general well-being of these patients were assessed quantitatively on admission and at 3rd and 6th months of follow-up after receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) and aggressive intravenous iron therapy for anaemia correction. The median study duration was 6 years. Statistical analysis also showed the positive impact of anaemia correction which, even when partial, caused significant improvement in cardiovascular function as evidenced by increase in EF (p = 0.004) and decrease in LVMI (p = 0.016) along with substantial enhancement of general well-being (p < 0.001). Cognition did not show significant change within a short spell of 6 months. This study thus emphasises on earliest detection and correction of anaemia in CRD population to enhance both short-term and long-term survival as a whole.",

"Dietary fibre plays an important role in controlling postprandial glycemic and insulin response in diabetic patients. The intake of dietary fibre has been shown to delay the gastric emptying in healthy subjects. The relationship between gastric emptying and postprandial blood glucose in diabetic patients with fibre-load liquids needs to be investigated. To investigate the impact of soluble dietary fibre (SDF) on gastric emptying, postprandial glycemic and insulin response in patients with type 2 diabetes. 30 patients with type 2 diabetes (DM) and 10 healthy subjects (HS) matched for gender and age were randomized to receive SDF-free liquid (500 mL, 500 Kcal) and isoenergetic SDF liquid (oat Î²-glucan 7.5 g, 500 mL, 500 Kcal) on two separate days based on a cross-over with 6-day wash-out period. Gastric emptying was monitored by ultrasonography at intervals of 30 min for 2 hours. Fasting and postprandial blood was collected at intervals of 30-60 min for 180 min to determine plasma glucose and insulin. Proximal gastric emptying was delayed by SDF-treatment both in DM (p=0.001) and HS (p=0.037). SDF resulted in less output volume in the distal stomach in DM (p<0.05). SDF decreased postprandial glucose (p=0.001) and insulin (p=0.001) in DM subjects. Postprandial glucose (r=-0.547, p=0.047) and insulin (r=-0.566, p=0.004) were negatively correlated with distal emptying of SDF in DM subjects. Distal gastric emptying was delayed significantly in DM subjects with HbA1c levels â¥6.5% (p=0.021) or with complications (p=0.011) by SDF, respectively. SDF improved postprandial glycaemia which was related to slowing of gastric emptying.",

"Left ventricular (LV) mass and the LV ejection fraction (LVEF) are major independent predictors of future cardiovascular disease. The association of LV mass with the future LVEF in younger populations has not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation of LV mass index (LVMI) at ages 23 to 35 years to LV function after 20 years of follow-up in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. CARDIA is a longitudinal study that enrolled young adults in 1985 and 1986. In this study, participants with echocardiographic examinations at years 5 and 25 were included. LVMI and the LVEF were assessed using M-mode echocardiography at year 5 and using M-mode and 2-dimensional imaging at year 25. Statistical analytic models assessed the correlation between LVMI and LV functional parameters cross-sectionally and longitudinally. A total of 2,339 participants were included. The mean LVEF at year 25 was 62%. Although there was no cross-sectional correlation between LVMI and the LVEF at year 5, there was a small but statistically significant negative correlation between LVMI at year 5 and the LVEF 20 years later (r = -0.10, p <0.0001); this inverse association persisted for LVMI in the multivariate model. High LVMI was an independent predictor of systolic dysfunction (LVEF <50%) 20 years later (odds ratio 1.46, p = 0.0018). In conclusion, LVMI in young adulthood in association with chronic risk exposure affects systolic function in middle age; the antecedents of heart failure may occur at younger ages than previously thought.",
"A growing body of evidence supports an association between vitamin D and cardiovascular disease. However, the mechanisms underlying this association are unknown. From 2000 to 2002, we identified 946 participants with stable cardiovascular disease in San Francisco, California, and followed them prospectively for cardiovascular events (heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death). We then examined the extent to which the association was attenuated by adjustment for poor health behaviors, comorbid health conditions, and potential biological mediators. During a median follow-up period of 8.0 years (through August 24, 2012), 323 subjects (34.1%) experienced a cardiovascular event. Following adjustment for sociodemographic factors, season of blood measurement, health behaviors, and comorbid conditions, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels under 20 ng/mL remained independently associated with cardiovascular events (hazard ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval: 1.01, 1.67). However, after further adjustment for potential biological mediators, the independent association was no longer present (hazard ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 0.85, 1.44). Parathyroid hormone, a potentially modifiable biological factor downstream from 25-hydroxyvitamin D, was responsible for the majority of this attenuation. These findings highlight the need for randomized controlled trials to determine whether vitamin D supplementation in persons with deficiency could be beneficial for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.",
"This is the largest study to compare the efficacy and safety of an SGLT2 inhibitor with an SU in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin to date. In addition to determining the effects of these treatments on glycemic control over the long term, this study will investigate effects on beta-cell function, cardiovascular risk factors and markers of renal function/damage. The results will help to inform the choice of second-line treatment in patients with T2DM who have failed on metformin.",
"We examined effects of a 3-month football training programme in overweight children using comprehensive echocardiography and peripheral arterial tonometry. Twenty preadolescent overweight children (17 boys, 3 girls aged 8-12 yrs; body mass index [BMI] â¥ 85(th) percentile) participated in a structured 3-month football training programme, consisting of 4 weekly 60-90 min sessions with mean heart rate (HR) > 80% of HRmax (football group, FG). A parallel control group (CG) included 11 children (7 boys, 4 girls) of equivalent age from an obesity clinic. After 3 months, systolic blood pressure was unchanged in FG, but had increased in CG (112 [s 6] vs. 122 [10] mmHg, P = 0.02). FG demonstrated increased left ventricular (LV) posterior wall diameter (0.60 [0.07] vs. 0.68 [0.10] cm, P < 0.001) and an improved right ventricular systolic function determined by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE, 2.01 [0.29] vs. 2.27 [0.28] cm, P = 0.003). Measures of LV systolic function showed only discrete alterations and two-dimensional (2D) global strain was not changed. After 3 months, global isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRTglobal) had increased in FG (64.0 [7.5] vs. 73.9 [9.4] ms, P < 0.001) while other examined LV diastolic function variables were not altered. No echocardiographic changes were observed in CG. Between-group differences in pre-post delta values were observed for systolic blood pressure, TAPSE, and IVRTglobal (P = 0.02-0.03). We conclude that short-term football training may have positive structural and functional effects on the cardiovascular system in overweight preadolescent children.",

"Intravenous amiodarone (AIV) is used to treat cardiac arrhythmias. Hypotension is the dose-limiting adverse event of AIV and is considered to be due to the cosolvents (polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol) in the formulation. To minimize hypotension, the initial loading dose of AIV (150 mg) is diluted to 1.5 mg/ml and slowly infused over 10 minutes. PM101 is a cosolvent-free intravenous formulation of amiodarone. The present study was designed to assess any potential hypotensive effect of PM101 (50 mg/ml) on the administration of the loading dose (150 mg) as an undiluted bolus push. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled study in healthy human subjects receiving placebo (5% dextrose in water, n = 112) or PM101 (bolus push, n = 112). The primary end point was the noninferiority assessment of placebo versus PM101 for change in systolic blood pressure. For comparison, the standard loading dose of AIV (150 mg) was infused at 1.5 mg/ml over 10 minutes, and a rapid loading dose of AIV (150 mg) was infused undiluted (50 mg/ml) over 15 seconds. PM101 was noninferior to placebo, with changes from baseline systolic blood pressure for placebo and PM101 of -4.25 +/- 4.2 and -4.83 +/- 5.0 mm Hg, respectively. Neither regimen of AIV altered systolic blood pressure compared to placebo. Transient and significant increases in heart rate were observed in both AIV groups and with PM101 but not placebo. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that PM101 is devoid of hypotension in healthy human subjects. The absence of a hypotensive effect of AIV in this population suggests that further evaluation is needed in a patient population with cardiac disease.",

"Sexual dimorphism in the prevalence of migraine (70% women 30% men) suggests the involvement of reproductive hormones in a women's life. Excessive estrogen during menstruation directly stimulate estrogen receptor alpha thickly populated in trigeminal ganglia and periaqueductal gray which manifest as menstrual migraine. In contrast increased progesterone during pregnancy evokes progesterone receptors A/B, which coexist with ERs, providing complete remission from migraine episodes. Moreover, estrogen also increases nociception through extracellularly signal-regulated kinase (ERK) stimulation and down-regulating antinociceptive GABA, IL-R1 and Zn-fingers. Hormones may provoke migraine indirectly by disrupting mineral homeostasis. Estrogen enhances the absorption and half-life of copper which in turn inhibits the absorption of zinc. Zinc is required for the synthesis of melatonin and CoQ10 essential for growing women. Excess of copper exacerbates the deficiency of zinc, melatonin and CoQ10 typically low in migraineurs. Melatonin is an antioxidant, free radical scavenger and activates antioxidant enzymes like CuZn-superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase (a Se-enzyme) and glutathione reductase. Zinc deficiency reduces activity of CuZn-SOD. Magnesium and vitamin B6 modulates the level of NO in the cell, both of which are deficient in migraineurs. Magnesium is essential for the removal of trapped NO from within the cell which does not occur under low magnesium levels, which reacts with superoxide generating dangerous peroxynitrite. Iron stimulates nitric oxide synthase producing more NO which is inhibited by zinc, thus, antagonizing peroxynitrite generation. Female hormones lowers magnesium but increase calcium levels which enhance migraine ubiquitousness. Accumulation of copper and iron in deep areas of brain and peripheral nerves typically catalyses the oxidation of catecholamines and generate free radicals involved in lipid-peroxidation, demyelination, denudation of axons and neurodegeneration in specific areas exposing hyperalgesic axons provoking Classical migraine. Furthermore, zinc is an essential component of Zn-fingers (Krox20 and Krox24) which play a pivotal role in the differentiation of Schwann cells-the mainstay for the myelination/remyelination of peripheral nerves. Taken together, conceptually and logically, 30 migraineurs were administered 75 mg of zinc sulfate orally in water daily for 6 weeks+one capsule of vitamin B-complex+one capsule of vitamin A or E (first 10 days) which almost cured all of them. Placebo controlled trials with incremental doses of zinc sulfate along with magnesium and selenium are proposed to augment recovery involving large population of migraineurs. Monitoring of hair and blood mineral analysis for rational therapy is recommended.",

"Successful efforts to reduce cardiovascular disease in many countries have come as a result of both population based interventions and individually guided interventions. Guidelines serve two purposes directed at the promotion of the individually guided interventions. First, they serve as a method to summarize approved and successful life-style and medical interventions to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease. Second, they guide health providers on how to identify those at high risk for cardiovascular disease and who might benefit from the available interventions. However, guidelines have been increasingly complex and at times contradictory from one body to another or they may not exist at all in certain countries. This paper will review the current status of guidelines for the region as well as for individual countries. Guidelines for the prevention of CVD as a whole will be evaluated as well as guidelines for individual risk factors such as hypertension, cholesterol, and diabetes. Finally, this paper will address the pitfalls of individual risk factor based guidelines as opposed to the absolute risk approach integrating multiple risk factors into one comprehensive set of guidelines.",

"Cardiac arrhythmias are a complication of myocarditis. There are no large studies of in-hospital arrhythmia development and outcomes in pediatric patients with acute myocarditis. This was a retrospective 2-center review of patients â¤21 years hospitalized with acute myocarditis from 1996 to 2012. Fulminant myocarditis was defined as the need for inotropic support within 24 hours of presentation. Acute arrhythmias occurred at presentation and subacute after admission. Eighty-five patients (59% men) presented at a median age of 10 years (1 day to 18 years). Arrhythmias occurred in 38 patients (45%): 16 acute, 12 subacute, and 9 acute and subacute (1 onset unknown). Arrhythmias were associated with low voltages on the electrocardiogram (14 of 34, 41% vs 6 of 47, 13%; odds ratio [OR] 4.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.60 to 14.31) and worse outcome (mechanical support, orthotopic heart transplant, or death; OR 7.59, 95% CI 2.61 to 22.07) but were not statistically significantly associated with a fulminant course, ST changes, initial myocardial function, lactate, creatinine level, C-reactive protein and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or troponin I level, after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Subacute arrhythmias were associated with preceding ST changes (10 of 15, 67% vs 15 of 59, 25%, OR 5.87, 95% CI 1.73 to 19.93). All patients surviving to discharge had arrhythmia resolution or control before discharge (10 on antiarrhythmic), with 1 exception (patient with complete heart block requiring a pacemaker). At 1-year follow-up, there were 3 recurrences of ventricular arrhythmias, but no arrhythmia-related mortality. In conclusion, arrhythmias are common in pediatric patients with myocarditis, occurring in nearly 1/2 of all hospitalized children and are associated with a worse outcome. Early identification of subacute arrhythmias using electrocardiographic changes may help management. A majority of patients do not require continued postdischarge arrhythmia treatment.",

"HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) have antimalarial activity in vitro and in murine models. The potential beneficial effect of HIV-1 PIs on malaria has not been studied in clinical settings. We used data from Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5208 sites where malaria is endemic to compare the incidence of clinically diagnosed malaria among HIV-infected adult women randomized to either lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) or to nevirapine (NVP)-based ART. We calculated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We conducted a recurrent events analysis that included both first and second clinical malarial episodes and also conducted analyses to assess the sensitivity of results to outcome misclassification. Among the 445 women in this analysis, 137 (31%) received a clinical diagnosis of malaria at least once during follow-up. Of these 137, 72 (53%) were randomized to LPV/r-based ART. Assignment to the LPV/r treatment group (n = 226) was not consistent with a large decrease in the hazard of first clinical malarial episode (hazard ratio = 1.11 [0.79 to 1.56]). The results were similar in the recurrent events analysis. Sensitivity analyses indicated the results were robust to reasonable levels of outcome misclassification. In this study, the treatment with LPV/r compared to NVP had no apparent beneficial effect on the incidence of clinical malaria among HIV-infected adult women. Additional research concerning the effects of PI-based therapy on the incidence of malaria diagnosed by more specific criteria and among groups at a higher risk for severe disease is warranted.",

"This prospective, multicenter, randomized, "unblinded," controlled clinical trial was designed to determine if the intrapleural instillation of 1500 mg of tetracycline hydrochloride would be effective in diminishing the ipsilateral rate of recurrence for spontaneous pneumothorax. During the 4-year enrollment period, 113 patients were assigned to the tetracycline group; 116 patients were assigned to the control group. During the 5-year study period, the recurrence rate in the tetracycline group (25%) was significantly less than that in the control group (41%). Use of tetracycline seemed to reduce the recurrence rates for patients with either primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax and for patients with either an initial or a recurrent pneumothorax. We conclude that the intrapleural administration of tetracycline in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduces the rate of ipsilateral recurrence but is associated with intense chest pain. Intrapleural tetracycline therapy is indicated for patients with a spontaneous pneumothorax who are hospitalized and are treated with tube thoracostomy.",
"A randomised trial was conducted in 82 centres using the porcine surfactant extract, Curosurf, to compare two regimens of multiple doses to treat infants with respiratory distress syndrome and arterial to alveolar oxygen tension ratio < 0.22. Infants were randomly allocated to a low dosage group (100 mg/kg initially, with two further doses at 12 and 24 hours to a maximum cumulative total of 300 mg/kg; n = 1069) or a high dosage group (200 mg/kg initially with up to four further doses of 100 mg/kg to a maximum cumulative total of 600 mg/kg; n = 1099). There was no difference between those allocated low and high dosage in the rates of death or oxygen dependency at 28 days (51.1% v 50.8%; difference -0.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.6% to 3.9%), death before discharge (25.0% v 23.5%; difference -1.5%, 95% CI -5.1% to 2.2%), and death or oxygen dependency at the expected date of delivery (32.2% v 31.0%; difference -1.2%, 95% CI -5.2% to 2.7%). For 14 predefined secondary measures of clinical outcome there were no significant differences between the groups but the comparison of duration of supplemental oxygen > 40% did attain significance; 48.4% of babies in the low dose group needed > 40% oxygen after three days compared with 42.6% of those in the high dose group. The total amount of surfactant administered in the low dose regimen (mean 242 mg phospholipid/kg) was probably enough to replace the entire pulmonary surfactant pool. Adopting the low dose regimen would lead to considerable cost savings, with no clinically significant loss in efficacy.",

This was a prospective, examiner masked, randomised and crossover study. Participants were 32 consecutive subjects, who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, with newly diagnosed OAG. Patients were randomised to either LTFC or DTFC for the first 1-month treatment phase after a 1-month washout period, without medical treatment, patients began with the opposite treatment for the second 1-month treatment period. Colour Doppler parameters in ophthalmic artery (OA) and posterior ciliary arteries (PCA), ocular perfusion pressure, IOP and systemic haemodynamics were assessed at each baseline and at the end of each treatment period. The main outcomes include peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV) and resistance index (RI) in OA and PCA. DTFC significantly increased EDV in OA from 7.55 (1.16) to 9.32 (1.22), p<0.0001, and in the PCA from 4.41 (0.70) to 5.36 (0.60), p<0.0001, and significantly decreased RI in OA from 0.775 (0.036) to 0.725 (0.032), p<0.0001, and in the PCA from 0.694 (0.045) to 0.634 (0.034). LTFC significantly decreased the EDV and significantly increased RI in PCA, p=0.0076 and p=0.0009, respectively. There were no statistical significant differences in the IOP lowering effect between both treatments. DTFC seems to have a beneficial vascular effect on retrobulbar vessels in OAG patients.",

"Clinical data on optimal management of mechanical complications of myocardial infarction are lacking. We retrospectively evaluated the effect of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) on 30-day survival in patients with postinfarction ventricular septal rupture (VSR, nÂ = 55) or acute mitral regurgitation (MR, nÂ = 26) who developed either cardiogenic shock (nÂ = 46) or severe hemodynamic instability that did not fulfill the criteria of shock (nÂ = 35). IABP was inserted in 83% of the patients with shock and 57% of those without shock. Thirty-five (76%) patients with shock and all unstable patients survived until surgical repair, which was performed within a median (interquartile range) of 1 (1 to 2) and 9 (2 to 18) days from the onset of the complication (p <0.001). All patients who did not undergo the operation died within 3Â days. Although MR presented more acutely, the patients' outcomes were similar to those with VSR. IABP support reduced 30-day mortality in the patients with shock (61% vs 100%, pÂ = 0.04) but not in the patients without shock (20% vs 27%, pÂ = 0.7). The benefit of IABP support in the shock cohort was driven mainly by reduction of preoperative mortality (11% vs 88%, p <0.001). Early progression of cardiogenic shock and unperformed surgery were the only independent predictors of 30-day mortality (hazard ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 8 and hazard ratio 5.1, 95% confidence interval 2.2 to 11, respectively; pÂ = 0.004 and p <0.001, respectively). In conclusion, we suggest that all patients with postinfarction VSR or acute MR with signs of cardiogenic shock should immediately receive IABP as a bridge to emergent surgical repair. In contrast, hemodynamically unstable patients without shock may be first stabilized by medical therapy, without additional benefit of IABP, before they undergo cardiac surgery.",

"As a leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide, selection pressure by Plasmodium falciparum continues to shape the human genome. Severe disturbances within the microcirculation result from the adhesion of infected erythrocytes to host receptors on monocytes, platelets, and endothelium.

We report a significant survival advantage attributed to blood group O and increased monocyte expression of CD36 and ICAM1 (CD54). The high case fatality rate syndromes of cerebral malaria and lactic acidosis were associated with high platelet CD36 expression and thrombocytopenia, and severe malaria anaemia was characterized by low ICAM1 expression. In a logistic regression model of disease severity, odds ratios for the mitigating effects of blood group O, CD36, and ICAM1 phenotypes were greater than that of sickle haemoglobin.

"HTx in neonates is mainstay therapy for those with severe cardiomyopathies and congenital heart disease. Fetal listing for HTx has been proposed as a way to increase the potential window for a donor with outcomes predicted to be similar to the neonatal population. Data from the PHTS, a prospective multicenter study, were used to examine the outcomes of fetuses listed between 1993 and 2009. Four thousand three hundred and sixty-five children were listed for HTx during this period. Fetuses comprised 1% and neonates 19.8% of listed patients. In those patients listed as fetus and transplanted, the median wait time from listing to HTx was 55Â days (range 4-255), with a median of 25Â days (range 0-233) after birth. By sixÂ months post-listing, a higher proportion of fetal listed patients had undergone HTx with a lower waitlist mortality when compared with neonate. There was no significant difference in survival following HTx between the two group (pÂ =Â 0.4).

"In a multicentric, open, preliminary trial, we evaluated the use of ginkgolide B, a herbal constituent extract from Ginkgo biloba tree leaves, in the prophylactic treatment of migraine with aura (MA). Fifty women suffering from migraine with typical aura, or migraine aura without headache, diagnosed according to International Headache Society criteria, entered a six-month study. They underwent a two month run-in period free of prophylactic drugs, followed by a four month treatment period (subdivided into two bimesters, TI and TII) with a combination of 60 mg ginkgo biloba terpenes phytosome, 11 mg coenzyme Q 10, and 8.7 mg vitamin B2 (Migrasoll), administered twice daily. A detailed diary reporting neurological symptoms, duration, and frequency of MA was compiled by patients throughout the trial. The number of MA significantly decreased during treatment (from 3.7 +/- 2.2 in the run-in period, to 2.0 +/- 1.9 during TI and to 1.2 +/- 1.6 during TII; Anova for repeated measures: P < 0.0001). There was also a statistically significant decrease in the average MA duration, which was 40.4 +/- 19.4 min during run-in, 28.2 +/- 19.9 during TI, and 17.6 +/- 20.6 during TII. Total disappearance of MA was observed in 11.1% patients during TI and in 42.2% of patients during T2. No serious adverse event was provoked by Migrasoll administration. Ginkgolide B is effective in reducing MA frequency and duration. The effect is clearly evident in the first bimester of treatment and is further enhanced during the second.",
"The management of children suffering from sickle cell disease [sickle cell anaemia (SCA) and sickle cell beta degree-thalassaemia (S beta degree-thal.)] has been the concern of all clinicians caring for these patients. Several agents have been tried for treatment, often limited by toxic side effects. Piracetam (2-oxo-l-pyrrolidine acetamide, Nootropyl), a cyclic derivative of gamma-amino butyrate, used for the treatment of psychosenescent syndromes with no known side effects, was considered as a possible therapeutic agent for sickle cell disease. Interest was focused on the use of piracetam when it was shown that it had an antisickling effect, both in vivo and in vitro. We initiated multicentre double-blind investigations in two groups of children suffering from sickle cell disease ranging in age from 3-6 to 6-12 years. The total number of patients included in the study were 87 (SCA = 79 and Hb S beta degree-thal. = 8) in 13 centres in 10 different regions of Saudi Arabia. Coded boxes of the drugs were received from the company (UCB) and were administered as intravenous infusion during crises and orally during the follow-up, for a period of up to 1 year. After decoding the code at the end of the study, the patients were grouped into those receiving placebo (n = 39), i.e. controls, or piracetam (n = 48), i.e. study cases. In terms of age, weight, height and severity index, number of blood transfusions received and number of hospitalization, both groups were statistically homogenous. Data analysis showed that the clinical severity of the disease, the number of crises, the extent of hospitalization and the blood transfusion requirements significantly decreased during piracetam treatment (p < 0.001), though no statistically significant changes occurred in the placebo group. However, in the levels of the haematological and biochemical parameters no significant changes were documented in both groups. In addition, the improvement in the clinical presentation of the disease continued even several months after discontinuation of the drug in the majority of the children, as judged from the low severity index value. Though our results point to the recommendation that piracetam can be used for the treatment of children suffering from sickle cell disease, both SCA and S beta degree-thal, it is advisable to conduct long-term and close follow-up treatment programmes using piracetam to establish its therapeutic value particularly in adults and to ascertain that there are no long-term toxic side effects.",

"Sitagliptin, an oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, lowers blood glucose when administered as monotherapy or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. TECOS will evaluate the effects of adding sitagliptin to usual diabetes care on cardiovascular outcomes and clinical safety. TECOS is a pragmatic, academically run, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven trial recruiting approximately 14,000 patients in 38 countries who have type 2 diabetes (T2DM), are at least 50 years old, have cardiovascular disease, and have an hemoglobin A1c value between 6.5% and 8.0%. Eligible participants will be receiving stable mono- or dual therapy with metformin, sulfonylurea, or pioglitazone, or insulin alone or in combination with metformin. Randomization is 1:1 to double-blind sitagliptin or matching placebo, in addition to existing therapy in a usual care setting. Follow-up occurs at 4-month intervals in year 1 and then twice yearly until 1300 confirmed primary end points have occurred. Glycemic equipoise between randomized groups is a desired aim. The primary composite cardiovascular endpoint is time to the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, with cardiovascular events adjudicated by an independent committee blinded to study therapy. TECOS is a pragmatic-design cardiovascular outcome trial assessing the cardiovascular effects of sitagliptin when added to usual T2DM management.",
"The clinical course and medical treatment of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are not well established, especially in patients with concomitant renal dysfunction. We performed a retrospective analysis of the prospective Korean Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry to assess the medical treatments and clinical outcomes of patients with CHF (Killip classes II or III) complicated by AMI, in the presence or absence of renal dysfunction. Of 13,498 patients with AMI, 2769 (20.5%) had CHF on admission. Compared to CHF patients with preserved renal function, in-hospital mortality and major adverse cardiac events were increased both at 1 month and at 1 year after discharge in patients with renal dysfunction (1154; 41.7%). Postdischarge use of aspirin, betablockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers and statins significantly reduced the 1-year mortality rate for CHF patients with renal dysfunction; such reduction was not observed for those without renal dysfunction, except in the case of aspirin. Patients with CHF complicating AMI, which is accompanied by renal dysfunction, are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes than patients without renal dysfunction. However, they receive fewer medications proven to reduce mortality rates.",

"We evaluated the clinico-surgical significance of pulmonary artery (PA) reconstruction using a patch of autologous pericardium/azygos venae substitute to treat central non-small cell lung cancer in 62 patients with pulmonary arteries invaded by tumor. According to TNM-classification, four patients were stage IIb, 46 were stage IIIa, and 12 were stage IIIb. Depending on tumor infiltration, surgical procedures included partial PA tangential resections/reconstructions by a patch of autologous azygos venae, a patch of autologous pericardium and complete PA sleeve resection and reconstruction by a custom-made autologous pericardial conduit interposition. 47 patients received postoperative chemotherapy and 19 received radiotherapy. There were 2 (3.2%) postoperative early deaths due to bronchial anastomotic leakage. Postoperative complications occurred in 17.7% (11/62) patients and all recovered uneventfully. Mean follow-up time after surgical resection was 49.5 (6-12) months and overall â¤1-, 3-, 5-, and â¥10-year survival rates were 80.2, 44.7, 31.4, and 23.1%, respectively. It was concluded that autologous pericardial patch and azygos vein patch reconstruction of PA were safe and effective. Regarding extended circumferential defects after sleeve resection in which end-to-end anastomosis is not feasible, autologous pericardial conduit interposition may be useful for reconstruction when a tumor extensively infiltrates full circumference of the PA.",

"No multi-site comparisons have tested whether seasonally cold temperature or climate exacerbate pain intensity in sickle cell disease (SCD). We examined seasonal SCD pain intensity and frequency patterns and compared them with concurrent climate conditions (temperature and barometric pressure) and geography of patient residence in the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea (MSH). We conducted a time series analysis of the monthly average daily pain intensity (0-9 scale) and pain frequency of the 299 MSH patients from December 1991 to December 1994. We used both an unobserved component model (UCM) and a nonparametric local regression (LOESS) to probe for a cycle and/or trend associated with the time series. We also examined base mixed regression models of season, monthly average temperature and barometric pressure, and geographic region as stand-alone predictors of pain intensity and frequency. Expanded models included additional predictor variables. UCM and LOESS analyses showed a cyclic pattern of pain intensity and frequency with peaks in late Fall/early Winter and troughs in Spring. Base regression models showed colder seasons were significantly associated with greater pain intensity (p = .0035) but not frequency (p = .07); higher monthly temperatures were significantly associated with both lower pain intensity and pain frequency, but higher monthly barometric pressures were significantly associated with greater pain intensity and frequency (all p's < .0001); and northern sites had nonsignificantly higher pain intensity (p = .40) and frequency (p = .07) than southern sites. This pattern of results did not change in expanded models including other predictors. Our results suggest that seasonably colder temperatures exacerbate sickle cell-related pain, but low barometric pressure does not, and geographic region of residence is not significantly related to pain in this sample.",

"1. In a 19 month period from June 1993 to December 1994, 60 patients (mean age 54.8 +/- 1.5 years s.e.m.; 32 males, 28 females) underwent unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy by one of us (JCR) for the treatment of hypertension due to primary aldosteronism (n = 48), phaeochromocytoma (n = 3) and cortisol-producing adenoma (n = 1) or to remove adrenal massess incidentally discovered on abdominal computerized tomography scanning ('incidentaloma') performed for other reasons (seven adenomas without biochemical evidence of excessive steroid hormone or catecholamine secretion and one carcinoma autonomously producing cortisol). 2. Compared with conventional open procedures, laparoscopic adrenalectomy was associated with reduced recovery time and a low complication rate (one pulmonary embolus and one port site incisional hernia). 3. Operation time with experience approximates that of open procedures (60 min), but is significantly longer in obese than in non-obese patients, and in males than in females. 4. Patients with adrenal causes of hypertension were cured or significantly improved by laparoscopic unilateral adrenalectomy. 5. Because of our concern regarding malignant potential of incidentalomas and high patient acceptance of laparoscopic techniques, we have reduced our size criteria for removal of incidentalomas.",

"The ability of T cells to activate antimicrobial pathways in infected macrophages is essential to host defence against many intracellular pathogens. Here, we compared the ability of two T-cell-mediated mechanisms to trigger antimicrobial responses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in humans, CD40 activation and the release of interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³). Given that IFN-Î³ activates a vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial response, we focused on induction of the key components of this pathway. We show that activation of human monocytes via CD40 ligand (CD40L) and IFN-Î³, alone, and in combination, induces the CYP27b1-hydroxylase, responsible for the conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) to the bioactive 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D), and the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The activation of the vitamin D pathway by CD40L and IFN-Î³ results in up-regulated expression of the antimicrobial peptides, cathelicidin and DEFB4, as well as induction of autophagy. Finally, activation of monocytes via CD40L and IFN-Î³ results in an antimicrobial activity against intracellular M.Â tuberculosis. Our data suggest that at least two parallel T-cell-mediated mechanisms, CD40L and IFN-Î³, activate the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway and trigger antimicrobial activity against intracellular M.Â tuberculosis, thereby contributing to human host defence against intracellular infection.",
"Rates of the primary outcome were 1.69% per year in the warfarin group, as compared with 1.53% per year in the group that received 110 mg of dabigatran (relative risk with dabigatran, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.11; P<0.001 for noninferiority) and 1.11% per year in the group that received 150 mg of dabigatran (relative risk, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.82; P<0.001 for superiority).

"Zinc deficiency is common in adult sickle-cell disease (SCD) patients. We previously demonstrated that zinc supplementation to adult SCD patients decreased the incidences of infections and hospital admissions. We hypothesize that zinc supplementation improves T-helper cell function and decreases vascular endothelial cell activation, oxidative stress, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB)-DNA binding in mononuclear cells (MNCs) in SCD patients. To test this hypothesis, 36 SCD patients were recruited and randomly divided into 2 groups. One group (n = 18) received 25-mg zinc orally thrice a day for 3 months. The other group (n = 18) received placebo. The results indicate that the zinc-supplemented group had decreased incidence of infections compared with the placebo group. After zinc supplementation, red blood cell, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit, (Hct), plasma zinc, and antioxidant power increased; plasma nitrite and nitrate (NOx), lipid peroxidation products, DNA oxidation products, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 decreased in the zinc-supplemented group, compared with the placebo group. Zinc-supplemented patients exhibited significant decreases in lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and IL-1beta mRNAs, and TNF-induced nuclear factor of kappaB-DNA binding in MNCs, compared with the placebo group. Ex vivo addition of zinc to MNCs isolated from the placebo subjects decreased TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNAs. Zinc supplementation also increased relative levels of IL-2 and IL-2Ralpha mRNAs in phytohemagglutinin-p-stimulated MNCs. These results suggest that zinc supplementation may be beneficial to SCD patients.",

"The extent to which dense and irreversible sickle cells (ISCs) contribute to vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell disease remains unclear. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibits dense cell and ISC formation in sickle erythrocytes in vitro and restores glutathione levels toward normal. A phase II double-blind randomized clinical trial was completed to determine the efficacy of NAC in decreasing dense cell and ISC formation, and vaso-occlusive episodes in sickle cell disease. Twenty-one subjects with a history of at least two vaso-occlusive episodes per year and 6% dense cells were enrolled. Four treatment groups were analyzed; NAC at a dose of 2,400 mg per day decreased the percent dense cells from 20.1 +/- 2.9 to 12.6 +/- 2.1 (P < 0.05) and increased red cell glutathione levels from 292.8 +/- 74.5 to 576.7 +/- 155.1 (P < 0.05). In addition, we observed a decrease in vaso-occlusive episodes from 0.03 to 0.006 episodes per person-days and a decreased in relative risk to R = 0.39. Although NAC did not significantly decrease the number of ISCs, there was a downward trend at all doses tested. In summary, NAC inhibited dense cell formation, restored glutathione levels toward normal, and decreased vaso-occlusive episodes at a well-tolerated dose of 2,400 mg per day. To determine the long-term efficacy and safety of NAC, a multicenter phase III clinical trial is required.",

"Adrenomedullin (ADM) is closely related to calcitonin gene-related peptide, which has a known causative role in migraine. Animal studies have strongly suggested that ADM has a vasodilatory effect within the cerebral circulation. For these reasons, ADM is also likely to be involved in migraine. However, the hypothetical migraine-inducing property and effect on human cerebral circulation of ADM have not previously been investigated. Human ADM (0.08 microg kg(-1) min(-1)) or placebo (saline 0.9%) was administered as a 20-min intravenous infusion to 12 patients suffering from migraine without aura in a crossover double-blind study. The occurrence of headache and associated symptoms were registered regularly 24 h post infusion. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by (133)Xenon single-photon emission computed tomography, mean blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V(MCA)) by transcranial Doppler and the diameter of peripheral arteries by transdermal ultrasound (C-scan). ADM did not induce significantly more headache or migraine compared with placebo (P = 0.58). CBF was unaffected by ADM infusion (global CBF, P = 0.32 and rCBF(MCA), P = 0.38) and the same applied for the V(MCA) (P = 0.18). The superficial temporal artery dilated compared with placebo (P < 0.001), and facial flushing was seen after ADM administration (P = 0.001). In conclusion, intravenous ADM is not a mediator of migraine headache and does not dilate intracranial arteries.",

"Internal jugular vein cannulation has become a routine and clinically important aspect of medical care of critically ill patients. The landmark guided technique usually affords rapid and easy vascular access, but is not always successful and may be complicated by arterial puncture, hematoma, or pneumothorax. Some categories of patients, in particular patients with no external landmarks and patients with coagulopathies, appear to be at an increased risk of complications. We report the experience of internal jugular vein cannulation by a single operator with the external landmark technique in 10 patients and with ultrasound guidance in 31 patients, including 12 high risk patients. These patients had severe coagulopathies due to hepatic failure, HELLP syndrome, excess of anticoagulation treatment, or they had no external anatomic landmarks because of anasarca or obesity, were unable to maintain the horizontal position, or were external landmark catheterization failures. With the availability of the ultrasound device, success and complication rates improved markedly, suggesting that the ultrasound technique is easy to learn and rapidly produces an improvement over the external landmark method. In particular the 13 cannulations performed in 12 high risk patients were all successful at the first attempt, with no complications. In the overall population successful cannulations improved from 80% to 100%, first attempt success from 20% to 87% and carotid punctures decreased from 33% to 3.2%. Our results confirm that ultrasound guided cannulation of the internal jugular vein allows safer operation in high risk patients or when access problems are anticipated.",

"Amodiaquine (AQ) is an antimalarial drug that was frequently combined with artesunate (AS) for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum and is now available as a fixed-dose combination. Despite its widespread use, the simultaneous pharmacokinetics in patients of AQ and its active metabolite, desethylamodiaquine (DAQ), were not characterized to date. The pharmacokinetics of AQ and DAQ in 54 adult patients receiving the AS/AQ combination were therefore investigated by the use of a population approach. AQ followed a 1-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination, as well as a first-order and irreversible transformation into DAQ, which in turn followed a 2-compartment model with first-order elimination from its central compartment. The mean AQ apparent clearance and distribution volume were 3,410 liters/h and 39,200 liters, respectively. The mean terminal elimination half-life of DAQ was 211 h. Body weight was found to explain the interindividual variability of the apparent volume of distribution of AQ and the elimination rate constant of DAQ. A new dosage form consisting of a fixed-dose combination of AS and AQ was found to have no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of AQ and DAQ. All patients achieved parasite clearance within 4 days following the initiation of the treatment, which prevented investigation of the possible relationship between DAQ exposure and treatment outcome. This study provided the first simultaneous pharmacokinetic model for AQ and DAQ.",

"Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were developed as an alternative to microscopy for malaria diagnosis. The RDTs detect malaria parasite antigen(s) in whole blood with high sensitivity and specificity. We assessed health worker malaria treatment practices after the introduction of RDTs in peripheral health facilities without microscopy. From December 2007 to October 2008, we introduced histidine-rich protein II (HRP-2)-based ParaHIT RDTs for routine use in 12 health facilities in Rufiji District, Tanzania. Health workers received training on how to perform RDTs for patients 5 years of age or older with fever or suspected malaria. Children < 5 years of age were to be treated empirically per national guidelines. Among the 30,195 patients seen at these 12 health facilities, 10,737 (35.6%) were tested with an RDT for malaria. 88.3% (9,405/10,648) of tested patients reported fever or history of fever and 2.7% (289/10,677) of all tested individuals were children < 5 years of age.

Among the 5,162 RDT-negative patients, only 205 (4.0%) were treated with an antimalarial. Other reported treatments included antibiotics and antipyretics. Implementation of RDTs in rural health facilities resulted in high adherence to national treatment guidelines. Patients testing negative by RDT were rarely treated with antimalarials. Unapproved antimalarials were seldom used. Health workers continued to follow guidelines for the empiric treatment of febrile children.",

A multiple logistic regression model (c-statistic 0.657, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61 to 0.71) showed that the risk of ischemic events was inversely related to trough dabigatran concentrations (p = 0.045), with age and previous stroke (both p < 0.0001) as significant covariates. Multiple logistic regression (c-statistic 0.715, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.74) showed major bleeding risk increased with dabigatran exposure (p < 0.0001), age (p < 0.0001), ASA use (p < 0.0003), and diabetes (p = 0.018) as significant covariates.",
"The prevalence and prognostic importance of diastolic dysfunction in type 2 diabetes has only recently been appreciated. We tested the hypothesis that in insulin treated type 2 diabetes (D), carbohydrate consumption induces oxidative stress resulting in further impairment of diastolic function beyond structural myocardial stiffness. The effects of a pure carbohydrate breakfast (48 g) on oxidative stress and cardiac function were studied in the fasting and postmeal states in subjects without hypertension or overt cardiac disease (moderately well controlled D, n=21 and controls without D, n=20). Studied variables included systolic and early diastolic (E') myocardial velocities, traditional metabolic and hemodynamic parameters, serum nitrotyrosine, and sVCAM-1. In D compared to control subjects, the postmeal increase (â) in glucose (1.44Â±2.78 vs. 0.11Â±0.72 mmol/l, p=0.04) and ânitrotyrosine (0.34Â±0.37 vs. -0.23Â±0.47 nM/l, p<0.001) were significantly higher. sVCAM-1 was higher in fasting and postmeal (p=0.02). E' was significantly lower in postmeal (7.3Â±1.3 vs. 9.6Â±1.3 cm/s, p<0.001) and fasting (p<0.001) whereas the rate pressure product was significantly higher (9 420Â±1 118 vs. 7 705Â±1 871 mm Hg/min, p<0.001). Multivariable regression models of the pooled data demonstrated that independent predictors for postmeal E' were ânitrotyrosine and septal thickness (RÂ² 0.466) and for fasting E' age, ânitrotyrosine, and septal thickness (RÂ² 0.400). In insulin requiring type 2 diabetes, carbohydrate consumption may induce oxidative stress that is associated with worsening diastolic function, indicating that this metabolic factor is an important determinant of diastolic dysfunction in the diabetic heart beyond the increase in structural myocardial stiffness.",

"In this study, we tested the hypothesis that impaired midwall shortening predicts cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). In patients with DM without overt cardiac disease, systolic left ventricular (LV) function analyzed by midwall shortening may be impaired although LV ejection fraction is preserved. Impaired midwall shortening is an early independent prognosticator of adverse clinical outcome in patients with arterial hypertension. We analyzed the echocardiographic data from 360 outpatients with DM collected during the years 1990 to 2007. Patients had no history or symptoms attributable to cardiac disease. Stress-corrected midwall shortening (sc-MS) was taken as index of systolic LV function and considered impaired if <89%. The study outcome was CV mortality. At baseline, impaired sc-MS was detected in 140 patients (39%). During a mean follow-up period of 11 years, 54 patients (15%) died, 31 (8.6%) of them from CV causes. CV deaths occurred in 21 of 140 patients (15%) with impaired sc-MS and in 10 of 220 patients (4.5%) with normal sc-MS (p=0.006). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that impaired sc-MS (hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.08, p=0.039), together with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 0.99, p=0.004), was independently associated with CV mortality even after adjustment for age, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c, left atrial diameter, and heart valve calcium. In conclusion, subclinical systolic LV dysfunction as measured by sc-MS occurs frequently in patients with DM without overt cardiac disease and independently predicts long-term CV mortality in such patients together with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate.",

"Heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Owing to the limited regenerative capacity of heart tissue, cardiac regenerative therapy has emerged as an attractive approach. Direct reprogramming of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) into cardiomyocytes may hold great potential for this purpose. We reported previously that induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (iCMs) can be directly generated from mouse cardiac fibroblasts in vitro and vivo by transduction of three transcription factors: Gata4, Mef2c, and Tbx5, collectively termed GMT. In the present study, we sought to determine whether human fibroblasts also could be converted to iCMs by defined factors. Our initial finding that GMT was not sufficient for cardiac induction in HCFs prompted us to screen for additional factors to promote cardiac reprogramming by analyzing multiple cardiac-specific gene induction with quantitative RT-PCR. The addition of Mesp1 and Myocd to GMT up-regulated a broader spectrum of cardiac genes in HCFs more efficiently compared with GMT alone. The HCFs and human dermal fibroblasts transduced with GMT, Mesp1, and Myocd (GMTMM) changed the cell morphology from a spindle shape to a rod-like or polygonal shape, expressed multiple cardiac-specific proteins, increased a broad range of cardiac genes and concomitantly suppressed fibroblast genes, and exhibited spontaneous Ca(2+) oscillations. Moreover, the cells matured to exhibit action potentials and contract synchronously in coculture with murine cardiomyocytes. A 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay revealed that the iCMs thus generated do not pass through a mitotic cell state. These findings demonstrate that human fibroblasts can be directly converted to iCMs by defined factors, which may facilitate future applications in regenerative medicine.",

"The social acceptability and durability of two house screening interventions were addressed using focus group discussions, questionnaires, indoor climate measurements, and durability surveys. Participants recognized that screening stopped mosquitoes (79-96%) and other insects (86-98%) entering their houses. These and other benefits were appreciated by significantly more recipients of full screening than users of screened ceilings. Full screened houses were 0.26Â°C hotter at night (P = 0.05) than houses with screened ceilings and 0.51Â°C (P < 0.001) hotter than houses with no screening (28.43Â°C), though only 9% of full screened house users and 17% of screened ceiling users complained about the heat. Although 71% of screened doors and 85% of ceilings had suffered some damage after 12 months, the average number of holes of any size was < 5 for doors and < 7 for ceilings. In conclusion, house screening is a well-appreciated and durable vector control tool.",
"Controversy persists regarding the use of antibiotics in association with t tube thoracostomy for trauma patients. We conducted a prospective randomized study of patients requiring tube thoracostomy for pneumo- and/or hemothorax complicating blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma in an attempt to assess the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic therapy. Fifty-eight patients were included in the study. The control group (Group I) included 28 patients who received no antibiotic therapy: the experimental group (Group II) included 30 patients who received cefoxitin (1.0 gm IV q 6 h) commencing before tube thoracostomy and terminating 12 hours after its removal. The incidence of infectious complications (pneumonia and/or empyema) was recorded. Among the patients not receiving antibiotics, eight of 28 (29%) developed infectious chest complications. Of the patients receiving antibiotics, there was one infectious complication (3%). This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.0227). Cultures demonstrated significant conversion from negative to positive both within each group and between groups. The organism most commonly recovered was S. aureus. Our findings strongly suggest that patients requiring tube thoracostomy for trauma, whether blunt or penetrating, should receive the benefit of systemic prophylactic antibiotic therapy.",

"Lack of point-of-care tests for tuberculosis (TB) result in diagnostic delay, and increased mortality and healthcare-related costs. The urine Determine(TM) TB-LAM point-of-care strip-test was evaluated in 335 prospectively-recruited hospitalised patients with suspected TB-HIV co-infection (group 1) and from 88 HIV-infected hospitalised patients with non-TB diagnoses (group 2). Cut-off point-specific analyses were performed using: 1) a microbiological reference standard (culture positive versus negative); and 2) a composite reference standard (exclusion of patients with clinical-TB from the culture-negative group). Using the microbiological reference and the manufacturer-recommended grade-1 cut-off point, LAM sensitivity and specificity was 66% (95% CI 57-74%). By contrast, using the composite reference sensitivity was 60% (95% CI 53-67%) and specificity improved to 96% (95% CI 89-100%) (p=0.001). The same pattern was seen when the grade-2 cut-off point was used (specificity 75% versus 96%; p=0.01). In group two patients specificity was poor using the grade-1 cut-off point, but improved significantly when the grade-2 cut-off point was used (90% versus 99%; p=0.009). The grade-2 cut-off point also offered superior inter-reader reliability (p=0.002). Sensitivity was highest in those with a CD4 <200 cells per mL. LAM combined with smear-microscopy was able to rule-in TB in 71% of Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture-positive patients. This preliminary study indicates that the LAM strip-test may be a potentially useful rapid rule-in test for TB in hospitalised patients with advanced immunosuppression. The grade 2, but not the manufacturer-recommended grade 1 cut-off point, offered superior rule-in utility and inter-reader reliability. Larger studies to evaluate cut-off points and diagnostic accuracy are urgently required.",

"The use of periclavicular brachial plexus block as regional anaesthesia for surgical procedures on the upper extremity is common. However, the proximity of the pleura results in a risk of pneumothorax. Without ultrasound monitoring, the pneumothorax risk has been reported to be as high as 6.1%. We conducted a prospective, observational study to examine the risk of pneumothorax in 6366 ultrasound-guided periclavicular plexus blocks. All patients with a clinically manifest and radiologically confirmed pneumothorax were analysed. Clinically symptomatic pneumothorax occurred in four patients (0.06%; 95% CI 0.001-0.124), in three of them after a two-day latency period. Ultrasound guidance does therefore appear to reduce the risk of pneumothorax. Although all of the anaesthesiologists involved in the complications had previously performed fewer than 20 blocks, we are not able to confirm that a block experience â¤ 20 is a significant risk factor. Faulty image-setting, inability to obtain a view of the needle tip and inadequate supervision are likely to be important risk factors.",

"We evaluated the efficacy of dexamethasone (DEX) in anti-SSA/Ro-exposed fetuses newly diagnosed with congenital heart block. Previous use of DEX has been anecdotal with varying reports of therapeutic benefit. This was a multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized study involving 30 pregnancies treated with DEX (22 with third-degree block, 6 with second-degree block, 2 with first-degree block) and 10 untreated (9 with third-degree block, 1 with first-degree block). Initial median ventricular rates, age at diagnosis, and degree of cardiac dysfunction were similar between groups. Six deaths occurred in the DEX group. There was no reversal of third-degree block with therapy or spontaneously. In fetuses treated with DEX, 1/6 with second-degree block progressed to third-degree block and 3 remained in second-degree block (postnatally 1 paced, 2 progressed to third degree); 2 reverted to normal sinus rhythm (NSR; postnatally 1 progressed to second degree). DEX reversed the 2 fetuses with first-degree block to NSR by 7 days with no regression at discontinuation. Absent DEX, the 1 with first-degree block detected at 38 weeks had NSR at birth (overall stability or improvement in 4 of 8 in the DEX group vs 1 of 1 in the non-DEX group). Median gestational birth age was 37 weeks in the DEX group versus 38 weeks in the non-DEX group (p = 0.019). Prematurity and small size for gestational age were restricted to the DEX group. Pacemaker use and growth parameters at birth and 1 year were similar between groups. In conclusion, these data confirm the irreversibility of third-degree block and progression of second- to third-degree block despite DEX. A potential benefit of DEX in reversing first- or second-degree block was supported in rare cases but should be weighed against potential steroid side effects such as growth restriction.",

In humans, the regulatory effect of training on muscle FNDC5 mRNA expression and subsequently irisin levels in plasma is more controversial. We recruited 26 inactive men (13 normoglycaemic and normal weight, controls; and 13 slightly hyperglycaemic and overweight, pre-diabetes group) aged 40-65 years for a 12-week intervention of combined endurance and strength training with four sessions of training per week. Before and after the 12-week intervention period, participants were exposed to an acute endurance workload of 45 min at 70% of VO(2max), and muscle biopsies were taken prior to and after exercise. Skeletal muscle mRNA for PGC1A and FNDC5 correlated and both PGC1A and FNDC5 mRNA levels increased after 12 weeks of training in both control and pre-diabetes subjects. Circulating irisin was reduced in response to 12 weeks of training, and was increased acutely (~1.2-fold) just after acute exercise. Plasma concentration of irisin was higher in pre-diabetes subjects compared with controls. There was little effect of 12 weeks of training on selected browning genes in subcutaneous adipose tissue. UCP1 mRNA did not correlate with FNDC5 expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue or skeletal muscle or with irisin levels in plasma. We observed no enhancing effect of long-term training on circulating irisin levels, and little or no effect of training on browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue in humans.",

"Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disorder is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by the almost constant development of hemangioblastomas in the central nervous system (cerebellum, spinal cord and retina). In addition, various types of tumors including renal cell carcinomas, pancreatic cysts and pheochromocytomas are frequently observed in VHL gene carriers. Linkage of the VHL locus to the RAF-1 oncogene on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25-26) has been recently reported. Pheochromocytoma is of particular interest because of the risk of inaugural malignant hypertensive crisis but especially because of a great degree of interfamily variability (from 0 to 92% of affected members in previously reported large kindreds). We have studied a French series of 25 pheochromocytoma (11 males, 14 females) in VHL affected patients. Twenty pheochromocytoma (80%) occurred in a familial context, whereas 5 (20%) were consistent with "apparent sporadic cases". The mean age at pheochromocytoma diagnosis was 27 years (5-55 years). Bilateral tumours have been documented in 13 cases (52%). The prevalence of pheochromocytoma revealing VHL was 14 out 25 (56%). In these cases, VHL diagnosis was considered up to 25 years later. In 6 cases (2 deceased) pheochromocytoma was the only manifestation of VHL. Thus, search for VHL must be systematic in the presence of pheochromocytoma, in the interest of the patients themselves and of potential at-risk family members (prevention of hypertensive crisis linked to latent tumours). Basic check-up (neurological and somatic examination, ophthalmoscopy, familial inquiry) may be completed with cerebral CT scan or MRI and abdominal ultrasonography followed, if positive or doubtful, by abdominal MRI or selective angiography.",

"Tuberculosis is the most prevalent infection worldwide. The emergence of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) isolates emphasizes that it is necessary to monitor drug resistance of the organism against anti-tubercular drugs. We analyzed 327 M. tuberculosis isolates from patients who were cared for at three different health care centers, hereinafter known as study areas (SAs), in North India. Of the 327 total M. tuberculosis isolates, 255 were from a tertiary health care center (Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh [SA-1]), 48 were from a District tuberculosis center (Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan [SA-2]), and 24 were from a different District tuberculosis center (Buxar, Bihar [SA-3]). Drug susceptibility testing against first-line antibiotics (viz. isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin, and ethambutol) was conducted for all the isolates using 1% proportional method. We found that the rates of acquired resistance were consistently higher than the rates of initial drug resistance. In new, untreated cases, a higher degree of MDR-TB was observed at SA-1 (13.3%) and SA-3 (25.0%), whereas it was observed in only 7.1% of the isolates at SA-2. In previously treated patients, MDR cases were found in 35.7% of the isolates from SA-1, 66.6% of the isolates from SA-2, and 43.8% of the isolates from SA-3. Resistance to a single drug was found at a much lower rate, ranging from 0.0 to 6.3% in new cases as well as previously treated cases. In conclusion, the primary resistance of M. tuberculosis is low, but acquired drug resistance is slightly higher in North India.",

Treated by acupuncture 3 times per week and drugs every night, patients from both groups were evaluated at week 0 (baseline), week 4, and week 16. The primary outcome was measured by the proportion of responders (defined as the proportion of patients with a reduction of migraine days by at least 50%). The secondary outcome measures included the number of migraine days, visual analogue scale (VAS, 0 to 10 cm) for pain, as well as the physical and mental component summary scores of the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36). The patients in the acupuncture group had better responder rates and fewer migraine days compared with the control group (P<.05), whereas there were no significant differences between the 2 groups in VAS scores and SF-36 physical and mental component summary scores (P>.05).

"This multi centre observational cohort study gives a view about the occurrence, clinical and laboratory presentation, localization, histological type and genetic background of pheochromocytoma (PHEO) and paraganglioma (PGL) in Eastern Slovakia. It included 28 patients (18 women + 10 men), of which 23 were diagnosed to have PHEO (82,1%) and 7 patients (25%) suffered from PGL with retroperitoneal, inguinal/pelvic and mediastinal distribution. Arterial hypertension was the major symptom present in 86 % with slight dominance of paroxysmal form (58%). In 3 cases (10,7%), the diagnosis was gained after differentiation of adrenal incidentaloma in asymptomatic patients. Five patients (17,8%) were classified to have malignant form of the disease. 9 patients (32,1%) were confirmed to have hereditary form - five of them (17,8%) with familiar medullar thyroid cancer (FMTC) and mutations in RET gene classified as multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A and 4 patients (14,3%) with germline mutations of SDHB gene, respectively. There was found a relatively high occurrence of other co-morbidities: thyroid disease in 20 patients (71,4%), impairment of glucose metabolism in 11 patients (39,3%) and apart from FMTC, 4 patients (14,3%) suffered also from other malignancy. Together with a bigger size of the primary tumor (6,6 cm), higher concentrations of metanephrines and prevalence of extra-adrenal tumors, malignant and hereditary forms, we suppose genetic and environmental factors of Eastern Slovakia may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of the tumors.",

"A periprocedural myocardial infarction, defined as the advent of new Q-waves or a creatine kinase-MB elevation >83 normal has been previously validated as predictive of subsequent mortality. We examined the effects of using this clinically relevant definition of periprocedural myocardial infarction instead of the original protocol definition on outcomes in the recent PROTECT II [A Prospective, Multi-center, Randomized Controlled Trial of the IMPELLA RECOVER LP 2.5 System Versus Intra Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) in Patients Undergoing Non Emergent High Risk PCI] trial. In this trial, patients who were undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were randomized to either an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP, n[211) or a left ventricular assist device (Impella, n[216). All eligible patients per study protocol were included in the analysis. Patient outcomes were compared up to 90 days, the longest available follow-up, on the composite end points of major adverse events (MAE) and major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCE [ death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization). At 90 days, the rates of both composite end points were lower in the Impella group compared with the IABP group (MAE, 37% vs 49%, p [ 0.014 respectively; MACCE, 22% vs 31%, p [ 0.034 respectively). There were no differences in death or large myocardial infarction between the 2 arms. By multivariable analysis, treatment with Impella as opposed to IABP was an independent predictor for freedom from MAE (odds ratio[0.75 [95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.92], p[0.007) andMACCE (odds ratio[0.76 [95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.96], p[0.020) at 90 days postprocedure. In conclusion, hemodynamic support with Impella compared with IABP during high-risk PCI in the PROTECT-II trial resulted in improved event-free survival at 3-month follow-up; this finding was further supported by multivariate analyses.",
"Despite optimal treatment, including renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy have high cardiorenal morbidity and mortality related to residual albuminuria. We evaluated whether or not atrasentan, a selective endothelin A receptor antagonist, further reduces albuminuria when administered concomitantly with maximum tolerated labeled doses of RAS inhibitors. We enrolled 211 patients with type 2 diabetes, urine albumin/creatinine ratios of 300-3500 mg/g, and eGFRs of 30-75 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in two identically designed, parallel, multinational, double-blind studies. Participants were randomized to placebo (n=50) or to 0.75 mg/d (n=78) or 1.25 mg/d (n=83) atrasentan for 12 weeks. Compared with placebo, 0.75 mg and 1.25 mg atrasentan reduced urine albumin/creatinine ratios by an average of 35% and 38% (95% confidence intervals of 24 to 45 and 28 to 47, respectively) and reduced albuminuriaâ¥30% in 51% and 55% of participants, respectively. eGFR and office BP measurements did not change, whereas 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels decreased significantly in both treatment groups. Use of atrasentan was associated with a significant increase in weight and a reduction in hemoglobin, but rates of peripheral edema, heart failure, or other side effects did not differ between groups. However, more patients treated with 1.25 mg/d atrasentan discontinued due to adverse events. After stopping atrasentan for 30 days, measured parameters returned to pretreatment levels. In conclusion, atrasentan reduced albuminuria and improved BP and lipid spectrum with manageable fluid overload-related adverse events in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy receiving RAS inhibitors.",

"The management goal of sharp angular spinal deformity is to realign the spinal deformity and safely decompress the neurological elements. However, some shortcomings related to current osteotomy treatment for these deformities are still evident. We have developed a new spinal osteotomy technique-vertebral column decancellation (VCD), including multilevel vertebral decancellation, removal of residual disc, osteoclasis of the concave cortex, compression of the convex cortex accompanied by posterior instrumentation with pedicle screws, with the expectation to decrease surgical-related complications. From January 2004 to March 2007, 45 patients (27 males/18 females) with severe sharp angular spinal deformities at our institution underwent VCD. The diagnoses included 29 congenital kyphoscoliosis and 16 Pott's deformity. Preoperative and postoperative radiographic evaluation was performed. Intraoperative, postoperative and general complications were noted. For a kyphosis deformity, an average of 2.2 vertebrae was decancellated (range, 2-4 vertebrae). The mean preoperative kyphosis was +98.6Â° (range, 82Â°-138Â°), and the mean kyphosis in the immediate postoperative period was +16.4Â° (range, 4Â°-30Â°) with an average postoperative correction of +82.2Â° (range, 61Â°-124Â°). For a kyphoscoliosis deformity, the correction rate was 64% in the coronal plane (from 83.4Â°-30.0Â°) postoperatively and 32.5Â° (61% correction) at 2 years' follow-up. In the sagittal plane, the average preoperative curve of 88.5Â° was corrected to 28.6Â° immediately after surgery and to 31.0Â° at 2 years' follow-up. All patients had solid fusion at latest follow-up. Complications were encountered in eight patients (17.8%), including CSF leak (n = 1), deep wound infection (n = 1), epidural hematoma (n = 1), transient neurological deficit (n = 4), and complete paralysis (n = 1). The results of this study show that single-stage posterior VCD is an effective option to manage severe sharp angular spinal deformities.",

"The incidence rate of AKI in hospitalized patients is increasing. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the association of AKI with long-term risk of adverse coronary events. Our study investigated hospitalized patients who recovered from de novo dialysis-requiring AKI between 1999 and 2008 using patient data collected from inpatient claims from Taiwan National Health Insurance. We used Cox regression with time-varying covariates to adjust for subsequent CKD and ESRD after discharge. Results were further validated by analysis of a prospectively constructed database. Among 17,106 acute dialysis patients who were discharged, 4869 patients recovered from dialysis-requiring AKI (AKI recovery group) and were matched with 4869 patients without AKI (non-AKI group). The incidence rates of coronary events were 19.8 and 10.3 per 1000 person-years in the AKI recovery and non-AKI groups, respectively. AKI recovery associated with higher risk of coronary events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.36 to 2.04) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.57 to 1.79) independent of the effects of subsequent progression to CKD and ESRD. The risk levels of de novo coronary events after hospital discharge were similar in patients with diabetes alone and patients with AKI alone (P=0.23). Our results reveal that AKI with recovery associated with higher long-term risks of coronary events and death in this cohort, suggesting that AKI may identify patients with high risk of future coronary events. Enhanced postdischarge follow-up of renal function of patients who have recovered from temporary dialysis may be warranted.",

"A randomized, controlled clinical trial established the efficacy and safety of short-term use of hydroxyurea in adult sickle cell anemia. To examine the risks and benefits of long-term hydroxyurea usage, patients in this trial were followed for 17.5 years during which they could start or stop hydroxyurea. The purpose of this follow-up was to search for adverse outcomes and estimate mortality. For each outcome and for mortality, exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated, or tests were conducted at alpha = 0.05 level (P-value <0.05 for statistical significance). Although the death rate in the overall study cohort was high (43.1%; 4.4 per 100 person-years), mortality was reduced in individuals with long-term exposure to hydroxyurea. Survival curves demonstrated a significant reduction in deaths with long-term exposure. Twenty-four percent of deaths were due to pulmonary complications; 87.1% occurred in patients who never took hydroxyurea or took it for <5 years. Stroke, organ dysfunction, infection, and malignancy were similar in all groups. Our results, while no longer the product of a randomized study because of the ethical concerns of withholding an efficacious treatment, suggest that long-term use of hydroxyurea is safe and might decrease mortality.",

"Retention of patients in long term care and adherence to treatment regimens are a constant challenge for HIV, prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), and TB programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. This study describes the implementation and outcomes of an active defaulter tracing system used to reduce loss to follow-up (LTFU) among HIV, PMTCT, TB, and HIV/TB co-infected patients receiving treatment at three MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res clinics in the informal settlement of Kibera, Nairobi, Kenya. Patients are routinely contacted by a social worker via telephone, in-person visit, or both very soon after they miss an appointment. Patient outcomes identified through 1066 tracing activities conducted between 1 April 2008 and 31 March 2009 included: 59.4% returned to the clinic, 9.0% unable to return to clinic, 6.3% died, 4.7% refused to return to clinic, 4.5% went to a different clinic, and 0.8% were hospitalized. Fifteen percent of patients identified for tracing could not be contacted. LTFU among all HIV patients decreased from 21.2% in 2006 to 11.5% in 2009. An active defaulter tracing system is feasible in a resource poor setting, solicits feedback from patients, retains a mobile population of patients in care, and reduces LTFU among HIV, PMTCT, and TB patients.",

"In this pilot study it appears that trabeculectomy with OloGen does not seem to offer any significant advantages compared with trabeculectomy alone. Additionally, even though there were no statistical differences between the two groups as far as complications were concerned, one eye from the study group developed endophthalmitis 10 days after surgery and two eyes presented with positive Seidel test and flat anterior chamber and required additional suturing. Studies with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-ups are required to confirm these findings and to examine the safety and long-term outcomes of trabeculectomy with OloGen.",
"Pheochromocytoma is usually characterized by a marked increase in peripheral catecholamine secretion. Whether this is accompanied by an alteration in central sympathetic drive has not been clarified. In 6 patients with adrenal pheochromocytoma (mean+/-SEM age, 49. 3+/-7.2 years), we measured systolic and diastolic blood pressure (photoplethysmographic device), heart rate (ECG), venous plasma catecholamines (high-performance liquid chromatography), and postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography) before and 78.3+/-13 days after surgical removal of the tumor. In each experimental session, measurements were performed during (1) a 60-minute resting period to compare several values of sympathetic nerve traffic at similar blood pressures before and after surgery and (2) voluntary end-expiratory apnea, ie, a maneuver inducing sympathetic activation. Tumor removal significantly (P<0.05 at least) reduced plasma catecholamines, blood pressure, and heart rate. In contrast, muscle sympathetic nerve activity was significantly (P<0.01) increased, both when quantified as bursts per minute (from 28.1+/-5.7 to 54.3+/-7.5) and as bursts per 100 heartbeats (from 33. 4+/-5.6 to 65.1+/-6.5). This was also the case when data were evaluated in periods of 2 experimental sessions characterized by similar diastolic blood pressure values. The apnea maneuver induced sympathetic nerve traffic responses that were significantly (P<0.05) greater after surgery than before surgery. These data provide the first direct evidence that in pheochromocytoma central sympathetic outflow is markedly reduced and that this reduction cannot be ascribed to a reflex inhibitory response to elevated blood pressures. It is likely that this sympathoinhibition is rather due to a central depression of sympathetic outflow induced by high circulating catecholamines.",
"Angiotensin II and aldosterone are key factors responsible for the structural and neurohormonal remodeling of the atria and ventricles in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antiarrhythmic effects of spironolactone compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with recurrent AF. A cohort of 164 consecutive patients (mean age 66 years, 87 men), with an average 4-year history of recurrent AF episodes, was enrolled in a prospective, randomized, 12-month trial with 4 treatment arms: group A, spironolactone, enalapril, and a Î² blocker; group B, spironolactone and a Î² blocker; group C, enalapril plus a Î² blocker; and group D, a Î² blocker alone. The primary end point of the trial was the presence of symptomatic AF episodes documented on the electrocardiogram. At 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12 months, a significant (p < 0.001) reduction had occurred in the incidence of AF episodes in both spironolactone-treated groups (group A, spironolactone, enalapril, and a Î² blocker; and group B, spironolactone plus a Î² blocker) compared to the incidence in patients treated with enalapril and a Î² blocker (group C) or a Î² blocker alone (group D). No significant difference was seen in AF recurrences between patients taking spironolactone and a Î² blocker with (group A) and without (group B) enalapril. No significant differences were found in the systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate among the groups before and after 1 year of follow-up. In conclusion, combined spironolactone plus Î²-blocker treatment might be a simple and valuable option in preventing AF episodes in patients with normal left ventricular function and a history of refractory paroxysmal AF.",

"The use of hydroxyurea for the prevention of sickle cell crises in patients with homozygous HbS disease is now well established. The beneficial effects of this compound stem from (a) selective enrichment of red cells containing an increased amount of fetal hemoglobin, which inhibits HbS polymerization, and (b) a decrease of leukocytes, platelets, and reticulocytes, which significantly limits their adherence to the vascular wall. We report the results of a clinical trial of hydroxyurea on 55 Greek-origin patients with sickle cell/beta-thalassemia and 14 patients with homozygous HbS disease who have been treated with hydroxyurea for several years. Such patients have a higher probability to benefit from hydroxyurea therapy, since in addition to its antisickling effect, the increase of gamma-chain synthesis is expected to diminish the deleterious effects of the unbound alpha-globin chains. Selection of patients and monitoring throughout the whole trial were done by the same clinicians. Quantitative expression of the clinical condition was done using a system scoring several outcome parameters. For a period of 52 months prior to starting treatment, the total score of severity for 59 evaluable patients was 1182 points (3068 patient-weeks), while for the 12,018 patient-weeks of the trial this parameter fell to only 82 points. Other observations of interest include the significant improvement of a group of patients with hepatic cholestasis, the development of leg ulcers possibly related to the treatment, and the dramatic increase of hemoglobin F, often in association with an increase of the total hemoglobin levels as a result of decreased hemolysis.",
"Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy (IPTp) and insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are recommended malaria interventions during pregnancy; however, there is limited information on their efficacy in areas of low malaria transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. An individually-randomised placebo-controlled trial involving 5775 women of all parities examined the effect of IPTp, ITNs alone, or ITNs used in combination with IPTp on maternal anaemia and low birth weight (LBW) in a highland area of southwestern Uganda. The overall prevalence of malaria infection, maternal anaemia and LBW was 15.0%, 14.7% and 6.5%, respectively. Maternal and fetal outcomes were generally remarkably similar across all intervention groups (P>0.05 for all outcomes examined). A marginal difference in maternal haemoglobin was observed in the dual intervention group (12.57g/dl) compared with the IPTp and ITN alone groups (12.40g/dl and 12.44g/dl, respectively; P=0.04), but this was too slight to be of clinical importance. In conclusion, none of the preventive strategies was found to be superior to the others, and no substantial additional benefit to providing both IPTp and ITNs during routine antenatal services was observed. With ITNs offering a number of advantages over IPTp, yet showing comparable efficacy, we discuss why ITNs could be an appropriate preventive strategy for malaria control during pregnancy in areas of low and unstable transmission.",

"Pheochromocytoma accounts for approximately 25% of incidentally discovered adrenal masses. Certain diagnostic procedures (e.g., adrenal arteriography, needle biopsy of an adrenal mass), anesthesia and abdominal surgery may cause a sudden release of catecholamines from a pheochromocytoma and induce paroxysmal attacks of hypertension. In addition, pheochromocytoma is well known to cause unsuspected operating room deaths. Therefore, we must carefully separate this functioning neoplasm from other types of adrenal masses. In this study, we compared the results of noninvasive tests including (1) assay of urinary catecholamines and their metabolites, (2) a provocative pharmacologic test using metoclopramide (MCP test), and (3) 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy to screen for pheochromocytoma in 10 consecutive patients with an incidentally discovered adrenal mass (6 pheochromocytomas and 4 non-functioning adrenocortical adenomas). We measured the 24-hour urinary excretion of catecholamines, metanephrines and vanillyl mandelic acid in all 10 patients; 5 were positive, 4 were negative and 1 was false-negative (sensitivity = 83%, specificity = 100%). The MCP test was performed in 7 patients; 3 were positive, 3 were negative and 1 was false-negative (sensitivity = 75%, specificity = 100%). MIBG scintigraphy was performed in 7 patients; 4 were positive, 1 was negative and 2 were false-negative (sensitivity = 67%, specificity = 100%). According to these results, all patients with an incidentally discovered adrenal mass should undergo a determination of the 24-hour urinary excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites, including metanephrines. If this urine assay is negative, other noninvasive tests including the MCP test and MIBG scintigraphy should be considered in selected patients with radiographic characteristics of pheochromocytoma.",
"The aims of this survey was to provide insight into treatment activity, the strategy of treatment, and risk stratification of patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic ventricular pre-excitation across Europe. Fifty-eight centres, members of the European Heart Rhythm Association EP research network, covering 20 countries answered the survey questions. All centres were high-volume ablation centres. A younger person with asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern has a higher likelihood of being risk-stratified or receiving ablation therapy compared with an older subject. Two-thirds of centres report that they have observed a decline in the number of patients ablated for an accessory pathway during the last 10 years. Pre-excited atrial fibrillation is rarely seen. Discontinuation of a scheduled WPW ablation due to close vicinity of the accessory pathway to the AV node happens very rarely. Patients with a first episode of pre-excited atrial fibrillation would immediately be referred for catheter ablation to be performed within weeks by 80.4% of the centres. A significant proportion of responders (50.9%) would use electrical cardioversion to restore sinus rhythm in a patient with pre-excited atrial fibrillation. With respect to the choice of antiarrhythmic medication for a patient with pre-excited AF, the majority (80.0%) would choose class 1C antiarrhytmic drugs while waiting for a catheter ablation. A patient seen in the emergency room with a second episode of orthodromic atrioventricular reentry tachycardia would be referred for immediate ablation by 79.2-90.6% of centres depending on the presence of pre-excitation. The volume of paediatric ablations performed on children younger than 12 years was low (46.4%: 0 patients per year; 46.4%: 1-9 patients per year). The majority of responding centres (61-69%) report that their country lack national guidelines dealing with clinical strategies related to WPW. There is a need for national guidelines dealing with clinical strategy in patients with WPW syndrome. Older individuals with asymptomatic WPW pattern have a higher risk of not receiving risk stratification or curative therapy with ablation compared with younger patients, despite the higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation.",

"Chronic migraine (CM) is a prevalent and disabling neurological disorder. Few prophylactic treatments for CM have been investigated. OnabotulinumtoxinA, which inhibits the release of nociceptive mediators, such as glutamate, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide, has been evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled studies for the preventive treatment of a variety of headache disorders, including CM. These studies have yielded insight into appropriate patient selection, injection sites, dosages, and technique. Initial approaches used a set of fixed sites for the pericranial injections. However, the treatment approach evolved to include other sites that corresponded to the location of pain and tenderness in the individual patient in addition to the fixed sites. The Phase III REsearch Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) injection paradigm uses both fixed and follow-the-pain sites, with additional specific follow-the-pain sites considered depending on individual symptoms. The PREEMPT paradigm for injecting onabotulinumtoxinA has been shown to be safe, well-tolerated, and effective in well-designed, controlled clinical trials and is the evidence-based approach recommended to optimize clinical outcomes for patients with CM.",

"POTS (postural tachycardia syndrome) is a chronic form of OI (orthostatic intolerance). Neuropathic POTS is characterized by decreased adrenergic vasoconstriction, whereas hyperadrenergic POTS exhibits increased adrenergic vasoconstriction. We hypothesized that midodrine, an Î±1-adrenergic receptor agonist, would increase CVR (calf vascular resistance), decrease C(v) (calf venous capacitance) and decrease orthostatic tachycardia in neuropathic POTS, but not alter haemodynamics in hyperadrenergic POTS. A total of 20 POTS patients (12 neuropathic and eight hyperadrenergic), ages 12-20 years, participated in this randomized placebo-controlled double-blind cross-over study. Of these subjects, 15 were female. POTS subjects received 2 weeks of treatment with midodrine or placebo, with increased dosing from 2.5 to 10 mg three times daily. Following a 7-day drug-washout period, subjects received the cross-over treatment. HR (heart rate), MAP (mean arterial pressure), Q(calf) (calf blood flow) and CVR were measured supine and during 35Â° HUT (head-up tilt). C(v) was measured supine. In neuropathic POTS, midodrine decreased supine HR, Q(calf) and C(v), while increasing MAP and CVR compared with placebo. During HUT, in neuropathic POTS, midodrine decreased HR, Q(calf) and C(v), while increasing MAP and CVR. In hyperadrenergic POTS, placebo and midodrine both decreased upright HR and increased supine CVR. Placebo also increased supine C(v), compared with midodrine in hyperadrenergic POTS. Therefore midodrine improved postural tachycardia in neuropathic POTS by increasing CVR and decreasing Q(calf) and C(v), whereas these effects were not seen in hyperadrenergic POTS patients who experienced a placebo effect.

"Asymptomatically infected patients with falciparum malaria may develop symptomatic malaria infection secondary to injury or surgery. This complication increases the risk for postoperative wound infection and adds to the burden of trauma. The aims of the present study were to investigate the preventive effect of early antimalaria treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infected trauma patients, and to study the validity and accuracy of a rapid test to identify those infected. An open, non-randomized, interventional multi-center, cohort study was carried out at six district hospitals in northwestern Cambodia. Two hundred twenty-two trauma patients was examined for P. falciparum by dipstick test soon after injury. The patients testing positive were immediately treated with artesunate-mefloquine. A subset of 108 patients from Pailin, an area considered highly endemic for falciparum malaria, was used for the main analysis. Of 28 P. falciparum rapid test-positives, 21 developed symptomatic postinjury malaria despite early antimalarial treatment. The agreement between the dipstick test and blood smear examination was good (kappa 92.5; 95% CI 84.5-100). Early pre-operative treatment of parasite carriers does not seem to prevent symptomatic malaria after injury and surgery. The rapid test for falciparum malaria was reliable in early identification of asymptomatic P. falciparum infected patients.",

"We investigated the consistency between the headache diagnosis based on medical history and three treated headache episodes diagnosed based on a diary. In a randomized double-blind study including individuals with either migraine or tension-type headache (TTH) we showed significant superiority of the fixed combination of acetylsalicylic acid + paracetamol + caffeine over the combination without caffeine, the single preparations, and placebo in the treatment of headache. A neurologist performed a classification of the usual headache episodes and each of the three treated ones in a blinded fashion based on a structured questionnaire. This was done for the 1734 patients included in the efficacy analysis who usually treated their episodic TTH or migraine attacks with non-prescription analgesics. The overall percentage of patients with migraine and TTH remained relatively stable. The treated headache episodes were between 75 and 77% migraine, 18-20% were TTH and 5-7% could not be classified. We observed some shift in headache type within patients from prior history and in treated attacks. In 60% of patients all three treated episodes were of the type initially diagnosed by the neurologist by history (56% migraine and 4% episodic TTH). Of those with an initial diagnosis of migraine, 24% had at least one attack meeting criteria for TTH. Of patients with an initial diagnosis of TTH, 54% had at least one attack meeting the diagnostic criteria for migraine. Our results demonstrate that an initial headache diagnosis does not accurately predict the headache type treated in a randomized trial. Symptom features of treated headaches should be captured to ensure that the attack is of the type targeted by the clinical trial. The International Headache Society Guidelines for controlled clinical trials should be updated accordingly.",

"The aim of the study was to determine whether epicardial adipose tissue thickness (EAT), a new cardiometabolic risk factor, is associated with essential hypertension. The sample included 127 asymptomatic patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors consecutively referred for cardiac computed tomography angiography. Data were collected retrospectively and compared between hypertensive (n=39) and normotensive (n=88) patients. The hypertensive patients had a significantly higher mean EAT thickness than the normotensive group (2.81Â±1.6Â mm vs 2.07Â±1.43Â mm; P=.011) and a significantly elevated mean coronary artery calcium score (316.8Â±512.6 vs 108.73Â±215; P=.0257). The odds ratio for a patient with tissue thickness â¥2.4Â mm having hypertension was 1.396 (95% confidence interval, 1.033-1.922). Factors independently associated with hypertension were body mass index, low-density lipoprotein, and age. A model score was developed using the logistic regression coefficients for calculation of individual risk. Hypertensive patients have significantly higher than normal EAT thickness.

"Atrial Fibrillation management is still a matter for debate. Past research has largely been based on the outpatient setting in which patients are followed during ambulatory visits. Very little data exist on the optimal management of AF in the Emergency Department (ED). This study investigated which factors drive different AF treatments in the ED, describing their use in different hospitals. Finally, the efficacy of different strategies in terms of cardioversion in the ED was analyzed. Charts of patients treated for atrial fibrillation (AF) were collected in 6 EDs in a large metropolitan area over a 24-consecutive month period and were reviewed and analysed. Demographics, comorbidities, treatment strategy and ED outcome were collected. Inclusion criteria were symptom onset <3 weeks and stable hemodynamic conditions at presentation. A propensity score was used to adjust for baseline clinical characteristics and to compare the efficacy of different treatments. 3,085 patients were included in the analysis. Variables associated with a rhythm control strategy were onset of symptoms <48 h, age, dyspnea, palpitations, renal failure and the presence of a mechanical valve. Different EDs applied different strategies in terms of drugs used and the electrocardioversion rate, showing heterogeneity in AF management. Adjusting for the propensity score, electrocardioversion and antidysrhythmic drugs of class Ic were more effective than a wait-and-watch strategy in the ED. Despite international guidelines being respected, AF management is heterogeneous in different ED settings. A rhythm control strategy with electrocardioversion and Class Ic drugs is more effective than a wait-and watch approach during the ED visit. Further research, toward an evidence-based approach to the emergent management of AF in the ED, is still needed.",

"This prospective clinical study evaluates the possible beneficial effects of increased phenoxybenzamine dosage in the preoperative treatment of patients with pheochromocytoma. For this purpose total blood volume (TBV) prior to and after treatment with phenoxybenzamine and hemodynamic changes during surgery were determined in two groups of patients: group I (n = 12) received a mean dosage of 140 mg, group II (n = 12) 270 mg/day. The mean TBV in group I showed no changes after treatment with phenoxybenzamine, while the TBV in group II increased by 5.6 ml/kg body weight, corresponding to an increase in plasma volume (PV) of 10.2%. These changes were not significant, however. The intraoperative vasodilator requirement for the treatment of catecholamine induced hypertension during tumor manipulation was significantly less for group II: total nitroprusside administration averaged 8.7 mg in group I and 0.8 mg in group II (P less than 0.0005). Patients in group I received a total of 2.6 mg nitroglycerin compared with only 0.5 mg for patients in group II (P less than 0.005). In conclusion, preoperative treatment of patients with pheochromocytoma with increased dosages of phenoxybenzamine is beneficial to intraoperative management by decreasing hemodynamic instability due to tumor manipulation and following resection. This treatment was effective for preventing complications such as excessive tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertensive crises, or left ventricular failure.",

"Seven sickle cell disease (SCD) patients [sickle cell anaemia = 4 (males 2, females 2, age range 18-40 years), and sickle cell beta (0)-thalassaemia = 3 (all females, age range 20-47 years)], suffering from a severe form of the disease were enrolled in a treatment protocol using hydroxyurea (HU) for up to 12 months followed by a combination therapy with HU and human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEpo; using 400 U/kg/week i.v.) for 3-4 weeks. Following the withdrawal of rHuEpo the patients were maintained on HU alone. The patients were characterised on the basis of the 'severity index' prior to the initiation of the therapy. Haematological and relevant biochemical parameters, Hb A2 fetal haemoglobin (HbF), HbF cells, reticulocytes and platelet counts were estimated at least at three occasions to determine the mean and range of the parameters. During the treatment period the patients were followed every 2-4 weeks where the haematological and biochemical parameters were assessed. The results were separately analysed and mean +/- SD were obtained for each parameter at the end of each protocol. The statistical significance of the difference in the results obtained on treatment and the baseline results was examined using the paired t test. No toxic side effects of HU and rHuEpo (as judged from reduction in platelet and white blood cell count) were documented during and after the whole period of treatment. The patients showed a significant clinical improvement. Total haemoglobin, haematocrit, red cell count, HbF and HbF cells increased, while white blood cells, reticulocyte counts and bilirubin level decreased. Platelet count decreased but remained within the normal range. The results revealed that 5 of the patients on HU treatment showed a significant increase in the HbF level and HbF cells, while 2 patients (1 sickle cell anaemia and 1 Hb S/beta(0)-thalassaemia patient) did not and were considered as 'non-responders'. The rHuEpo and HU combination therapy elevated the HbF level, with a varying degree, in all patients except 2, who had already reached a high HbF level and showed a decrease in HbF during the rHuEpo protocol. Variable individual response to both HU and rHuEpo therapy was a common feature. We recommend the use of HU for the treatment of SCD and a combination therapy using HU and rHuEpo for the non-responders.",

"We compared the ventilatory requirements of 127 infants who received phenobarbital for five days with those of 111 infants who received placebo. All infants were intubated, weighted less than 1750 g at birth, and survived the first ten days of life. Those infants who received phenobarbital did not require ventilatory assistance for more days than did placebo receivers. However, a pneumothorax or pulmonary interstitial emphysema was more likely to develop in infants who received phenobarbital than in infants who received placebo, even when adjustment was made for the presence of subependymal-intraventricular hemorrhage. We believe this is the first report of this relationship and recommend additional studies to test the hypothesis that phenobarbital contributes to the occurrence/recognition of pneumothorax or pulmonary interstitial emphysema in very-low-birth-weight infants if phenobarbital continues to be used routinely as prophylaxis or treatment.",

"The aim of this study was to determine the impact of mean platelet volume (MPV) on the strategy for treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) with respect to stroke prevention. MPV was analyzed in 265 patients with AF who were undergoing treatment using rhythm or rate control. The primary endpoint was ischemic stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA) event. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly higher stroke rate in the rate control group compared to the rhythm control group. A significantly higher stroke rate was observed in the higher tertile MPV group (â¥7.9 fL) compared to the lower tertile MPV group (<7.3 fL). When the MPV cut-off level was set to 7.85 fL using the receiver operating characteristic curve, the sensitivity was 80.0% and the specificity was 70.4% for differentiating between the group with stroke and the group without stroke. In the Cox proportional hazard analysis, after adjusting for sex, treatment strategy for AF, high MPV level, antithrombotic treatment, and high CHADS2 score, higher MPV, rate control strategy for treatment of AF, and high CHADS2 score were found to be independent predictors of stroke risk. In addition, patients with AF who were treated using rate control had high stroke risk with an MPV over 7.85 fL and high CHADS2 score. The results of this study demonstrate that the MPV and the rate control strategy for treatment of AF were predictive markers for stroke; its predictive power for stroke was independent of female sex and high CHADS2 score in patients with AF.",

"An open-labeled randomized trial with parallel groups was carried out to study the effects of Dif1stat (Monascus purpureus-Linear aliphatic alcohols-Niacin) in the treatment of primary moderate hypercholesterolemia. The trial lasted 8 months. The patients, males and females, were assigned to two groups: A (#130), treated with diet, and B (#110) submitted to diet + Dif1stat. After 4 months, group A did not show significant changes in Total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDLC), HDL-cholesterol (HDLC) or non-HDL-cholesterol (non-HDLC). The same group, showed a reduction in TC (-22%), LDLC (-30%) and non-HDLC (-27%) after 8 months (P < or = 0.001). After 4 months, TC (-21.3%), LDLC (-29%), and non-HDLC (-26%) were significantly lowered in group B (P < or = 0.001). In group B, TC, LDLC and non-HDLC showed a further reduction after 8 months: -29.4, -38 and -37%, respectively (P < or = 0.001). Even triglycerides (TG) decreased significantly (-33%) (P < or = 0.001). After 8 months, group B showed a significant reduction of TG (-33%) (P < or = 0.001), when compared to group A. Some safety parameters were significantly reduced in both groups: AST and gamma-GT in group A after 4 and 8 months, as well as ALT, AST and gamma-GT in group B after 8 months (P < or = 0.001). Dif1stat, given with a suitable diet, was well tolerated in the long-term and induced an anti-atherogenic plasma lipid and lipoprotein profile, in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia.",

"In order to study the pharmacokinetic properties of amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine during pregnancy, 24 pregnant women in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and with Plasmodium vivax malaria were treated with amodiaquine (10 mg/kg of body weight/day) for 3 days. The same women were studied again at 3 months postpartum. Plasma was analyzed for amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine by use of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Individual concentration-time data were evaluated using noncompartmental analysis. There were no clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of amodiaquine and desethylamodiaquine between pregnant (n = 24) and postpartum (n = 18) women.

"OBJECTIVEâ- Cerebral infarction preferentially affects the posterior cerebral artery distribution in migraine patients. The results obtained from the few known studies that have compared the anterior and posterior cerebral endothelial function are contradictory. To the best of our knowledge, cerebrovascular reactivity to L-arginine (CVR), measured by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD), has not been previously used to determine the posterior cerebral endothelial function in migraine patients with (MwA) and without aura (MwoA). MATERIALS AND METHODSâ-â Forty migraine patients without comorbidities (20âMwA, 20âMwoA) and 20 healthy subjects were included. By employing strict inclusion criteria, we avoided the possible vascular risk factors. Mean arterial velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) was measured by TCD before and after infusion of L-arginine, and CVR to L-arginine was then calculated. RESULTSâ-âAll migraine patients had lower CVR to L-arginine in PCA (P = 0.002) and similar in MCA (P = 0.29) compared to healthy subjects. This difference was also present in MwA and MwoA compared to healthy subjects (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONSâ-â Lower CVR to L-arginine in PCA in migraine patients could associate migraine and cerebral infarcts that are more common in the posterior cerebral artery distribution.",

"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is recognized as a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. An ability to identify patients with HFpEF who are at increased risk for adverse outcomes can facilitate their more careful management. We studied the patients having heart failure (HF) using data from the Heart Failure Adherence and Retention Trial (HART). HART enrolled 902 patients in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or III who had been recently hospitalized for HF to study the impact of self-management counseling on the primary outcome of death or HF hospitalization. In HART, 208 patients had HFpEF and 692 had HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and were followed for a median of 1,080Â days. Two final multivariate models were developed. In patients having HFpEF, predictors of primary outcome were male gender (odds ratio [OR] 3.45, pÂ = 0.004), NYHA class III (OR 3.05, pÂ = 0.008), distance covered on a 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) of <620 feet (OR 2.81, pÂ = 0.013), and <80% adherence to prescribed medications (OR 2.61, pÂ = 0.018). In patients having HFrEF, the predictors were being on diuretics (OR 3.06, pÂ = 0.001), having â¥3 co-morbidities (OR 2.11, pÂ = 0.0001), distance covered on a 6-MWT of <620 feet (OR 1.94, pÂ = 0.001), NYHA class III (OR 1.90, pÂ = 0.001), and age >65Â years (OR 1.63, pÂ = 0.01). In conclusion, indicators of functional status (6-MWT and NYHA class) were common to both patients with HFpEF and those with HFrEF, whereas gender and adherence to prescribed therapy were unique to patients having HFpEF in predicting death or HF hospitalization.",

"Despite the already wide experience with video-assisted techniques in laparoscopic surgery, video-assisted thoracic surgery only recently came to be developed. This is clearly seen in a survey reflecting the experience among Belgian surgeons. A majority of the surgeons (63%) had limited experience (1 to 5 interventions), and only 28.5% had fairly considerable (between 11 and 20 interventions) or considerable (more than 20 interventions) experience. The majority of interventions performed were the treatment of pneumothorax, lung biopsies, wedge resections, and intrathoracic staging procedures, accounting for 209 (70%) of the 296 interventions collected in this survey. The remaining interventions display a wide variety of different thoracic procedures including lobectomy (4) and esophagectomy (20) for carcinoma. The overall technical success rate was 91% in this survey. Our own experience with 71 interventions or attempts reflects the same evolution with an overall technical success rate in 85% (60 patients). Pneumothorax was the most frequently performed intervention (35 patients), with a technical success rate of 94.5% (32 patients). Recurrences requiring further treatment occurred in 5 of the 32 patients (14.3%). All recurrences occurred before endostaplers were available, after which there were no failures in 12 consecutive cases. Other procedures successfully performed were lung biopsy/wedge resection (6), lung cancer staging procedures (3), lobectomy (1), hemothorax (3), chest wall neurinoma (2), sympathectomy (5), dorsal mediastinal neurinoma (1), thymectomy (1), esophagectomy (3), benign esophageal tumor enucleation (2), and Belsey Mark IV antireflux procedure (1). Furthermore, special emphasis was given to the development of video-assisted mediastinoscopy, which greatly facilitates teaching and interpreting this operation. Endoscopic myotomy using endostaplers was performed in 2 patients with Zenker's diverticulum. From our experience, however, it becomes clear that thoracoscopic approaches do not always result in a distinct benefit for the patient, as these procedures are more time consuming and usually require one-lung ventilation (probably the cause of the only fatal outcome in this series: a lung biopsy in an 85-year-old patient). In conclusion, video-assisted thoracic and thoracoscopic surgery is a new surgical modality offering new perspectives. However, careful patient selection and the same expertise as in open procedures are essential in determining the final outcome of each procedure.",

"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most lethal form of tuberculosis, and new treatments that improve outcomes are required. We randomly assigned adults with TBM to treatment with standard antituberculosis treatment alone or in combination with ciprofloxacin (750 mg/12 h), levofloxacin (500 mg/12 h), or gatifloxacin (400 mg/24 h) for the first 60 days of therapy. Fluoroquinolone concentrations were measured with plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens taken at predetermined, randomly assigned times throughout treatment. We aimed to describe the pharmacokinetics of each fluoroquinolone during TBM treatment and evaluate the relationship between drug exposure and clinical response over 270 days of therapy (Controlled Trials number ISRCTN07062956). Sixty-one patients with TBM were randomly assigned to treatment with no fluoroquinolone (n = 15), ciprofloxacin (n = 16), levofloxacin (n = 15), or gatifloxacin (n = 15). Cerebrospinal fluid penetration, measured by the ratio of the plasma area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)) to the cerebrospinal fluid AUC(0-24), was greater for levofloxacin (median, 0.74; range, 0.58 to 1.03) than for gatifloxacin (median, 0.48; range, 0.47 to 0.50) or ciprofloxacin (median, 0.26; range, 0.11 to 0.77). Univariable and multivariable analyses of fluoroquinolone exposure against a range of different treatment responses revealed worse outcomes among patients with lower and higher plasma and CSF exposures than for patients with intermediate exposures (a U-shaped exposure-response). TBM patients most likely to benefit from fluoroquinolone therapy were identified, along with exposure-response relationships associated with improved outcomes. Fluoroquinolones add antituberculosis activity to the standard treatment regimen, but to improve outcomes of TBM, they must be started early, before the onset of coma.",

"Hydroxyurea is used since close to 10 years in the treatment of major sickle cell anemia. In African sub Sahara, very little study have been dedicated. Yet, this drug represents nowadays, an alternative tot the bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of this illness. This study permits to illustrate the beneficial effects of this drung on 132 patients affected by of major sickle cell anemia. It is about patients whose middle age is of 28 years (range 14 and 54 years), most frequently masculine sex, followed regularly in the service of haematology of CHUB. The treatment consisted to the administration of the hydroxyurea to the posology between 10 and 30 mg/kg per day. The essentially clinical assessment focused on the sickle cell anemia crises and the modifications of hematologic's parameters. The experimentation has been pursued beyond the 18th month among 108 patients. It takes out again of this survey disappearances of the vasculo occlusive crises among 103 patients on 132 (78.03%) during the first 18 months of the survey. Only 10 patients (7.57%) benefited blood transfusion during the period of the survey because of the infectious complications. The hydroxyurea led a meaningful and spontaneous increase of the haemoglobin rate (+2,54 g/dl) of the middle globular volume (+ 16,02 femtolitres) as well as of the rate of haemoglobin foetale on 65 estimated patients. The hydroxyurea didn't bring any objective improvement on the pre-existing dÃ©nÃ©nÃ©ratives complications. The treatment has been interrupted precociously among 5 patients for cytopenia. This survey confirms to short and middle term the beneficial effects of the hydroxyurea on the major sickle cell anaemia.",

"This study compared the efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes of four regimens: amodiaquine-sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (AQ-SP) and mefloquine-artesunate (MQ-AS), with and without primaquine (PQ) administered with the second dose of the schizonticide (AQ-SP; AQ-SP-PQ; MQ-AS; MQ-AS-PQ). Efficacy was determined by thick smear on days 1, 4 and 8 after the beginning of treatment. A total of 82 patients (19-23/group) were recruited. After AQ-SP administration, gametocytemia steadily increased until day 8. With AQ-SP-PQ, a marked decline in gametocytemia was detected on days 4 and 8. MQ-AS treatment resulted in reduced gametocytemia on days 4 and 8, and with MQ-AS-PQ it was reduced even further. None of the treatments cleared gametocytemia by day 8. Currently, artemisinin-based combination therapies plus PQ are the recommended treatment option against falciparum malaria; however, further studies are required to optimize the use of PQ. Issues to be addressed include the optimal time of administration, treatment duration, optimal daily and total dose, and day of evaluation of the gametocytocidal effect. In falciparum malaria, the WHO recommends a maximum of 4days of treatment; consequently, an effective regimen must clear asexual parasites and symptoms within this time frame. The same criteria should be taken into account when evaluating the anti-gametocyte activity.",

"The genetic component of susceptibility to malaria is both complex and multigenic and the better-known protective polymorphisms are those involving erythrocyte-specific structural proteins and enzymes. In vivo and in vitro data have suggested that pyruvate kinase deficiency, which causes a nonspherocytic haemolytic anaemia, could be protective against malaria severity in humans, but this hypothesis remains to be tested. In the present study, we conducted a combined analysis of Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pyruvate kinase-encoding gene (PKLR) and adjacent regions (chromosome 1q21) to look for malaria selective signatures in two sub-Saharan African populations from Angola and Mozambique, in several groups with different malaria infection outcome. A European population from Portugal, including a control and a pyruvate kinase-deficient group, was used for comparison. Data from STR and SNP loci spread along the PKLR gene region showed a considerably higher differentiation between African and Portuguese populations than that usually found for neutral markers. In addition, a wider region showing strong linkage disequilibrium was found in an uncomplicated malaria group, and a haplotype was found to be associated with this clinical group. Altogether, this data suggests that malaria selective pressure is acting in this genomic region.",

"The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide and India stands second next only to china. The management of diabetes in real life settings needs to be evaluated for deriving better management practices. A1chieve observational study evaluated the use of modern insulin in real life settings. This was a 24-week, international, prospective, multicenter, non-interventional, observational study of people with type 2 diabetes. India recruited with 20,554 subjects and a total of 1815 patients were enrolled to receive insulin aspart as bolus insulin therapy of whom 1450 (79.9%) were insulin naÃ¯ve and 365 (20.1%) were insulin users. At the end of 24 weeks, only one SAE was reported in this study and overall hypoglycemia events per patient year decreased from 2.49 (348 episodes) to 0.17 (20 episodes). There were no major hypoglycemic episodes reported in either insulin naive or insulin treated subjects. There was a significant improvement in the HbA(1c) values from the baseline in both insulin naive and insulin users. The mean HbA(1c) value was reduced from 9.5 to 7.4 (p < 0.001) for insulin naÃ¯ve subjects and from 9.2 to 7.7 (p < 0.001) in insulin experienced subjects. Fasting plasma glucose values decreased by 70 mg/dL and 50 mg/dL in insulin naive and insulin experienced, respectively and the difference from baseline was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The post prandial glucose value was also significantly (p < 0.001) reduced by 105 mg/dL for insulin naÃ¯ve subjects and 55 mg/dL for insulin experienced subjects. The composite end point was achieved by 46.6% of insulin naive and 38.1% of insulin-experienced subjects.

"Butyrate analogues have been shown to increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production in vitro and in vivo. Sodium phenylbutyrate (SPB), an oral agent used to treat individuals with urea-cycle disorders, has been shown to increase HbF in nonanemic individuals and in individuals with sickle cell disease. We have treated eleven patients with homozygous beta thalassemia (three transfusion dependent) and one sickle-beta-thalassemia patient with 20 g/d (forty 500-mg tablets) of SPB for 41 to 460 days. All patients showed an increase in the percent of F reticulocytes associated with treatment, but only four patients responded by increasing their Hb levels by greater than 1 g/dL (mean increase, 2.1 g/dL; range, 1.2 to 2.8 g/dL). None of the transfusion-dependent thalassemia subjects responded. Increase in Hb was associated with an increase in red blood cell number (mean increase, 0.62 x 10(12)/L), and mean corpuscular volume (mean increase, 6 fL). Changes in percent HbF, absolute HbF levels, or alpha- to non-alpha-globin ratios as measured by levels of mRNA and globin protein in peripheral blood did not correlate with response to treatment. Response to treatment was not associated with the type of beta-globin mutation, but baseline erythropoietin levels of greater than 120 mU/mL was seen in all responders and only two of eight nonresponders to SPB. Compliance with treatment was greater than 90% as measured by pill counts. Side effects of the drug included weight gain and/or edema caused by increase salt load in 2/12, transient epigastric discomfort in 7/12, and abnormal body odor in 3/12 subjects.

"In an analysis of cognitive function associated with the time in therapeutic range (TTR) in the Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial With Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events, 2510 patients (mean age, 71+/-9.5 years) from 27 countries completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Of these patients, 171 (6.8%) had an MMSE score <24, suggesting dementia, and 194 (7.7%) had intermediate scores of 24 to 25. Low MMSE scores were correlated with a low TTR. Even mild cognitive impairment was associated with a TTR below the median (<65%). Patients with an MMSE score <26 had more vascular events (6.7% versus 3.6% per 100 patient-years; P=0.002) and more bleeding (9.6% versus 7% per 100 patient-years; P=0.04). After controlling for TTR, the MMSE no longer conferred increased risk, suggesting that if improved anticoagulation was provided, vascular events and bleeding would be reduced. Other independent factors associated with a TTR <65% were region of the world, recent initiation of vitamin K antagonist, type of anticoagulant, and concurrent use of amiodarone or insulin. After adjustment for these factors, lower MMSE scores still predicted a reduced TTR.",

"Sickle cell disease is characterized by vaso-occlusive episodes, mainly in the small vessels, resulting in tissue ischemia, multi-organ failure, and, occasionally, death. Hydroxyurea (HU) is an agent with important and effective role in the treatment of patients suffering from this disease. The purpose of this study was to estimate the effect of HU on the deformability of the red blood cell's membrane (RBCM) in an effort to possibly improve the rheological properties of the RBCs of patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA), as well as to investigate the mechanical and rheological properties of these cells using micropipette and filtration techniques. The rigidity index, IR, which is a measure of cell rigidity and the elastic shear modulus, mu, which is a measure of cell's membrane deformability (CMd), of the RBCs from normal subjects, used as normal controls, were found significantly lower as compared to those of patients with SCA, regardless the treatment with HU. Patients under treatment with HU exhibited values better than those of untreated patients, in both, IR as well as mu, although still worse than the values of normal controls.",

"After acute myocardial infarction, the presence of no-reflow (or microvascular obstruction: MVO) has been associated with adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and worse clinical outcome. This study examined the effects of mechanical ischemic postconditioning on early and late MVO size in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. Fifty patients undergoing primary coronary angioplasty for a first STEMI with TIMI grade flow 0-1 and no collaterals were randomized to ischemic postconditioning (PC) (n = 25) or control (n = 25) groups. Ischemic PC consisted in the application of four consecutive cycles of a 1-min balloon occlusion, each followed by a 1-min deflation at the onset of reperfusion. Early (3 min post-contrast) and late (10 min post-contrast) MVO size were assessed by contrast-enhanced cardiac-MRI within 96 h after reperfusion. PC was associated with smaller early and late MVO size (3.9 Â± 4.8 in PC versus 7.8 Â± 6.6% of LV in controls for early MVO, P = 0.02; and 1.8 Â± 3.1 in PC versus 4.1 Â± 3.9% of LV in controls for late MVO; P = 0.01). This significant reduction was persistent after adjustment for thrombus aspiration, which neither had any significant effect on infarct size, nor on early or late MVO (P = NS for all). Attenuation of MVO was associated to infarct size reduction. Mechanical postconditioning significantly reduces MVO in patients with acute STEMI treated with primary angioplasty.",

"The possible effect of pentoxifylline (Trental) in sickle celle disease was tested in 2 clinical trials: a controlled double-blinded intravenous study involving patients hospitalized with painful crises and an ublinded 5-month oral study in steady state patients. In the intravenous trial 29 painful episodes were treated in 16 patients. Complete blood counts, serum chemistries, red cell density gradients, intracellular pH, p50, whole blood viscosity, plasma viscosity and red cell distribution widths were monitored daily during the hospital admission. We confirmed the decrease of dense red cells during crisis and found, in addition, the related significant decrease in whole blood p50. There were no major differences in any of these parameters when pentoxifylline was compared to placebo for each individual day. When the data was examined over time, minor differences emerged. The red cell distribution width, the number of cells in density fraction SS2 (discocytes) and the plasma viscosity were all slightly higher over time in the pentoxifylline group than in the control group. In the oral group 23 patients were monitored for the same parameters on seven visits during a five month period. Administration of oral pentoxifylline produced no changes from baseline for all parameters examined except for a statistically significant, but minor, increase in plasma viscosity demonstrable for these patients during one visit only. We conclude that pentoxifylline has little effect on laboratory parameters in sickle cell disease.",

"Clinical predictors of long-term outcomes in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) treated with endovascular therapy (EVT) remain unclear.

Cox models were used to estimate hazard ratios of death, limb loss, and sustained clinical success (SCS). Multivariate analysis showed that age, atrial fibrillation (AF), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and albumin were significant predictors of mortality. Patients with coronary artery disease and low albumin levels had a significant risk of major limb amputation, while AF, ESRD, and albumin were significant, independent predictors of SCS. In addition to previously reported predictors, we showed that AF and malnutrition can be used to predict long-term outcome in EVT-treated patients with CLI.",

"Artemisinin-resistant malaria along the Thailand-Cambodian border is an important public health concern, yet mechanisms of drug action and their contributions to the development of resistance are poorly understood. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral artesunate monotherapy were explored in a dose-ranging trial in an area of emerging artesunate resistance in western Cambodia. We enrolled 143 evaluable subjects with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in an open label study of directly observed artesunate monotherapy at 3 dose levels (2, 4, and 6 mg/kg of body weight/day) for 7 days at Tasanh Health Center, Tasanh, Cambodia. Clinical outcomes were similar among the 3 groups. Wide variability in artesunate and dihydroartemisinin concentrations in plasma was observed. No significant dose-effect or concentration-effect relationships between pharmacokinetic (PK) and parasite clearance parameters were observed, though baseline parasitemia was modestly correlated with increased parasite clearance times. The overall parasite clearance times were prolonged compared with the clearance times in a previous study at this site in 2006 to 2007, but this did not persist when the evaluation was limited to subjects with a comparable artesunate dose (4 mg/kg/day) and baseline parasitemia from the two studies. Reduced plasma drug levels with higher presentation parasitemias, previously hypothesized to result from partitioning into infected red blood cells, was not observed in this population with uncomplicated malaria. Neither in vitro parasite susceptibility nor plasma drug concentrations appeared to have a direct relationship with the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of oral artesunate on malaria parasites. While direct concentration-effect relationships were not found, it remains possible that a population PK modeling approach that allows modeling of greater dose separation might discern more-subtle relationships.",

"The present study formed part of a randomised controlled trial of telehealth for in-home monitoring to support people with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. We explored the experiences of patients and healthcare practitioners, and their perceptions of the telehealth model of care used in the trial. In addition to their usual diabetes care, participants receive diabetes care from a diabetes educator nurse via an in-home broadband communication device. On average, each patient participated in 14 videoconferences with a diabetes care coordinator during the 12-month trial period. Qualitative data was collected from two general practices and included semi-structured interviews and document review of patient clinical notes. A total of 12 people were interviewed: 8 health practitioners and 4 patients. Patients and health practitioners expressed a high level of satisfaction with the model of care provided. Patients also reported positive health and social outcomes as a result of being involved in the trial and indicated that in the main they had achieved their goals and were happy with their progress over the 12-month period. Analysis of interviews revealed three broad elements associated with the implementation of telehealth: interpersonal factors, operational problems and the wider health system context within which the general practices and trial team were operating. The findings suggest that adopting telehealth in the management of type 2 diabetes can lead to improved diabetes control, but more support is required to ensure sustainability and widespread implementation.",

"It has been observed that elderly patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) benefit from standard [an international normalised ratio (INR) goal of 2.0-3.0] oral anticoagulant treatment (OAT). The hypothesis that lower-intensity anticoagulation therapy can offset the higher bleeding risk in this population has never been tested in an 'ad hoc' clinical trial. Patients over 75 years of age with NVAF were randomised to receive warfarin to maintain the INR at 1.8 (range 1.5-2.0) or at a standard target of 2.5 (range 2.0-3.0). There were 135 patients in the low-intensity and 132 in the standard-intensity groups. During a mean follow-up lasting 5.1 years, 59 primary outcome events (thromboembolism and major haemorrhage) were recorded, 24 (3.5 per 100 patient-years) in the low-intensity group and 35 (5.0 per 100 patient-years) in the standard-intensity group (HR=0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.1, p=0.1). The reduction in the primary endpoint was mainly due to a diminution in major bleedings (1.9 vs. 3.0 per 100 patient-years; HR=0.6, 95% CI 0.3-1.2, p=0.1). The median achieved INR value was 1.86 in the low-intensity and 2.24 in the standard-intensity group (p<0.001). The frequency of INR testing was 26.1 +/- 13.5 vs. 24.3 +/- 11.6 days, p<0.0001). In this exploratory study we observed a low rate of stroke and major bleeding in elderly patients (>75) being managed in an anticoagulation clinic for primary stroke prevention with low-intensity anticoagulation (INR 1.5-2.0). However, further trials are needed to confirm the hypothesis generated by the present study.",

"Available laboratory test methods for the detection of elevated concentrations of catecholamines and their metabolites in urine and/or plasma are not always sensitive enough for the detection of pheochromocytoma. High-quality immunoassays for these compounds appear to be as accurate as high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Therefore, the current project aims to establish a new sensitive radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the measurement of free metanephrines in the plasma of patients in the work-up for pheochromocytoma. We report first results of an ongoing multicenter clinico-chemical evaluation study in hypertensive patients and normotensive volunteers. After an overnight fast plasma samples were collected on ice in EDTA- and heparin-coated tubes after insertion of an indwelling venous line and resting in the supine (patients) or sitting position (normal volunteers) for 30 min. Plasma metanephrines were measured by a newly developed RIA from IBL, Hamburg, Germany. Good agreement of the assay with the tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for normetanephrine (r2=0.975) and for metanephrine (r2=0.985) could be demonstrated. Both specimens, EDTA and heparin plasma, can be used with the same results. The RIA has a good precision of <15% in the normal range and of <10% in the elevated concentration range. Our preliminary data suggest a high validity of the newly developed RIA for measuring free metanephrine and normetanephrine in hypertensive subjects in both EDTA and heparin plasma. Further work is required to determine the accuracy of the test in larger patient populations and in patients with pheochromocytoma.",

"Regardless of its origin, the treatment of persisting or recurring spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) is classically surgical. To assess the contribution of thoracoscopy in the management of SP 100 consecutive patients with persistent or recurrent pneumothorax were treated at our unit by endoscopic procedure between 1992 and 1997 to obtain permanent pleurodesis and to treat the lung lesion responsible for the leak. There were 90 men and 10 women ranging in age from 16 to 60 years (mean age 28+/-12 years). The technique includes electrocoagulation of pleural blebs and thoracoscopic apical pleurectomy. All patients were subjected to physical examination and plain x-ray at 1 and 3 months and 1 year postoperatively. After completion of the procedure, air leaks disappeared in 90 cases, while 5 cases air leak ceased 5 to 7 days postoperatively. The remaining 5 cases were converted to an open procedure. The mean length of follow-up was 3 years. No patient required transfusion and there were no operative deaths. No recurrence of pneumothorax occurred and no major complications encountered.

"Ibutilide is a class III antiarrhythmic agent indicated for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to sinus rhythm (SR). The most serious complication of ibutilide is torsades de pointes (TdP). Magnesium has been successfully used for the treatment of TdP, but its use as a prophylactic agent for this arrhythmia has not yet been established. The present study investigated whether high dose of magnesium would increase the safety and efficacy of ibutilide administration. A total of 476 patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter who were candidates for conversion to SR were divided into 2 groups. Group A consisted of 229 patients who received ibutilide to convert atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to SR. Group B consisted of 247 patients who received an intravenous infusion of 5 g of magnesium sulfate for 1 hour followed by the administration of ibutilide. Then, another 5 g of magnesium were infused for 2 additional hours. Of the patients in groups A and B, 154 (67.3%) and 189 (76.5%), respectively, were converted to SR (p = 0.033). Ventricular arrhythmias (sustained, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and TdP) occurred significantly more often in group A than in group B (7.4% vs 1.2%, respectively, p = 0.002). TdP developed in 8 patients (3.5%) in group A and in none (0%) in group B (p = 0.009). The administration of magnesium (despite the high doses used) was well tolerated. In conclusion, the administration of high doses of magnesium probably makes ibutilide a much safer agent, and magnesium increased the conversion efficacy of ibutilide.",

"Accumulating evidence suggests that growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is associated with the severity and prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of GDF-15 on the regulation of cardiac remodeling is still poorly understood. In this present study, we demonstrate that GDF-15 blocks norepinephrine (NE)-induced myocardial hypertrophy through a novel pathway involving inhibition of EGFR transactivation. Both in vivo and in vitro assay indicate that NE was able to stimulate the synthesis of GDF-15. The up-regulation of GDF-15 feedback inhibits NE-induced myocardial hypertrophy, including quantitation of [(3)H]leucine incorporation, protein/DNA ratio, cell surface area, and ANP mRNA level. Further research shows that GDF-15 could inhibit the phosphorylation of EGF receptor and downstream kinases (AKT and ERK1/2) induced by NE. Clinical research also shows that serum GDF-15 levels in hypertensive patients were significant higher than in healthy volunteers and were positively correlated with the thickness of the posterior wall of the left ventricle, interventricular septum, and left ventricular mass, as well as the serum level of norepinephrine. In conclusion, NE induces myocardial hypertrophy and up-regulates GDF-15, and this up-regulation of GDF-15 negatively regulates NE-induced myocardial hypertrophy by inhibiting EGF receptor transactivation following NE stimulation.",

"Antithrombotic therapy is central to the management of atrial fibrillation. This analysis from the RHYTHM-atrial fibrillation (RHYTHM-AF) registry explored the appropriateness of antithrombotic therapy in relation to stroke risk and atrial fibrillation duration in patients with atrial fibrillation. RHYTHM-AF, a prospective multinational registry, enrolled consecutive adult patients with atrial fibrillation considered for cardioversion. We compared the type of antithrombotic therapy administered at the time of cardioversion and at discharge with stroke risk ("high stroke risk" defined by CHA2DS2-VASc >1) and duration of atrial fibrillation (â¤48 vs >48 hours or unknown duration). Of 2,972 patients who were cardioverted (34.5% through pharmacologic cardioversion [PCV] and 65.5% through electrical cardioversion [ECV]), 65% were at high risk of stroke and 30% presented with atrial fibrillation of >48-hour or unknown duration. At the time of PCV and ECV, 36% (n = 242) and 84% (n = 1,075) of high-risk patients, respectively, were taking vitamin K antagonists or heparin. At discharge, these rates increased to 62% (n = 414) and 93% (n = 1,191), respectively. Of all low-stroke risk patients with short-duration atrial fibrillation undergoing PCV (n = 260) and ECV (n = 111), 7% (n = 17) and 30% (n = 33), respectively, were taking vitamin K antagonists or heparin at the time of cardioversion. At discharge, these rates increased to 19% (n = 50) and 40% (n = 44), respectively. In conclusion, ECV was frequently performed under appropriate antithrombotic therapy for most high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation, whereas PCV was frequently performed without appropriate antithrombotic therapy. To enhance pericardioversion stroke prevention, cardioversion algorithms should focus less on the type of conversion and more on stroke risk factors and atrial fibrillation duration.",

"Combination therapy with angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) requires further evaluation in patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension. In a post hoc analysis of the Olmesartan Reducing Incidence of Endstage renal disease in diabetic Nephropathy Trial with hypertension, we examined the effects of olmesartan on renal and cardiovascular outcomes in the presence or absence of an ACEI. Among 563 patients randomized to receive either olmesartan (n = 280) or placebo (n = 283), 73.5% (n = 414) received a concomitant ACEI. Compared with placebo, olmesartan significantly reduced proteinuria in both the ACEI-treated and non-ACEI-treated groups. The respective changes in the urinary protein creatinine ratio in the olmesartan-treated and placebo-treated groups were -32.6% and +21.1% without an ACEI (P = 0.001) and -17.0% and +2.2% with an ACEI (P = 0.028). In the olmesartan group, 115 patients developed primary renal outcomes (41.1%) compared with 129 (45.6%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio (HR): 0.97, P = 0.787). The respective HRs in the ACEI-treated and non-ACEI-treated groups were 1.02 (P = 0.891) and 0.84 (P = 0.450). 40 olmesartan-treated patients (14.3%) and 53 placebo-treated patients (18.7%) developed secondary cardiovascular outcomes (HR: 0.65, P = 0.042). The respective HRs in the ACEI-treated and non-ACEI-treated groups were 0.69 (P = 0.129) and 0.51 (P = 0.129). Olmesartan was well tolerated. Dual blockade treatment caused more hyperkalemia than monotherapy. In patients with diabetic nephropathy and hypertension, olmesartan significantly reduced proteinuria, independent of ACEI treatment and cardiovascular outcome but failed to show additional renal benefit compared with ACEI treatment alone. The cardiovascular benefit of dual treatment requires further evaluation.",
"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by progressive vascular injury and its pathophysiology is strikingly similar to that of atherosclerosis. Statins decrease inflammation and improve endothelial function in cardiovascular disease, but their effect in SCD is not known. In this pilot study, we examined the safety and effect of short-term simvastatin on biomarkers of vascular dysfunction in SCD. We treated 26 SCD patients with simvastatin, 20 or 40 mg/d, for 21 d. Plasma nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), tissue factor (TF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were analyzed and responses to simvastatin were compared between the two treatment groups. Simvastatin increased NOx levels by 23% in the low-dose (P =0Â·01) and 106% in the moderate-dose (P =0Â·01) groups, and by 52% overall (P=0Â·0008). CRP decreased similarly in both dose groups and by 68% overall (P =0Â·02). Levels of IL-6 decreased by 50% (P=0Â·04) and 71% (P<0Â·05) in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively. Simvastatin had no effect on VEGF, VCAM1 or TF. Simvastatin was well-tolerated and safe. Our preliminary findings showing a dose-related effect of simvastatin on levels of NOx, CRP and IL-6 suggest a potential therapeutic role for simvastatin in SCD.",
"Previous studies have determined the short-term toxicity profile, laboratory changes, and clinical efficacy associated with hydroxyurea (HU) therapy in adults with sickle cell anemia. The safety and efficacy of this agent in pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia has not been determined. Children with sickle cell anemia, age 5 to 15 years, were eligible for this multicenter Phase I/II trial. HU was started at 15 mg/kg/d and escalated to 30 mg/kg/d unless the patient experienced laboratory toxicity. Patients were monitored by 2-week visits to assess compliance, toxicity, clinical adverse events, growth parameters, and laboratory efficacy associated with HU treatment. Eighty-four children were enrolled between December 1994 and March 1996. Sixty-eight children reached maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 52 were treated at MTD for 1 year. Significant hematologic changes included increases in hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and fetal hemoglobin parameters, and decreases in white blood cell, neutrophil, platelet, and reticulocyte counts. Laboratory toxicities typically were mild, transient, and were reversible upon temporary discontinuation of HU. No life-threatening clinical adverse events occurred and no child experienced growth failure. This Phase I/II trial shows that HU therapy is safe for children with sickle cell anemia when treatment was directed by a pediatric hematologist. HU in children induces similar laboratory changes as in adults. Phase III trials to determine if HU can prevent chronic organ damage in children with sickle cell anemia are warranted.",

"Red blood cell (RBC) hydration is regulated in part by the Ca(2+) -activated K(+) efflux (Gardos) channel. Senicapoc selectively blocks potassium efflux through the Gardos channel, reducing RBC dehydration and haemolysis, and increasing haemoglobin levels in sickle cell disease (SCD). This randomized, placebo-controlled trial was designed to determine the safety and clinical efficacy of senicapoc in SCD patients. One hundred and forty-five patients were randomized to receive senicapoc and 144 patients to receive placebo for 52 weeks. Consistent with a previous study, patients in the senicapoc group had significantly increased haematocrit, haemoglobin, and decreased numbers of both dense erythrocytes and reticulocytes when compared to the placebo group. The unblinded Data Monitoring Committee terminated this study early due to a lack of efficacy when it determined that, despite improvements in anaemia and haemolysis, no significant improvement in the rate of sickle cell painful crises was observed in patients treated with senicapoc compared to those on placebo (0Â·38 vs. 0Â·31, respectively). Comparisons of the times to first, second and third crises between the senicapoc and placebo groups were not statistically significant. Nausea and urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in the senicapoc group than placebo. Serious adverse events were similar in the two groups.",

"To investigate the consequences of intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) timing on birth weight, we pooled data from two studies conducted in Benin between 2005 and 2010: a prospective cohort of 1037 pregnant women and a randomised trial comparing sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to mefloquine in 1601 women. A total of 1439 women (752 in the cohort and 687 in the SP arm of the randomised trial) who delivered live singletons were analysed. We showed that an early intake of the first SP dose (4 months of gestation) was associated with a lower risk of LBW compared to a late intake (6-7 months of gestation) (aOR = 0.5 p = 0.01). We also found a borderline increased risk of placental infection when the first SP dose was administered early in pregnancy (aOR = 1.7 p = 0.1). This study is the first to investigate the timing of SP administration during pregnancy. We clearly demonstrated that women who had an early intake of the first SP dose were less at risk of LBW compared to those who had a late intake. Pregnant women should be encouraged to attend antenatal visits early to get their first SP dose and a third dose of SP could be recommended to cover the whole duration of pregnancy and to avoid late infections of the placenta.",

"Two identical randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies were conducted to evaluate consistency of response to sumatriptan/naproxen sodium 85/500 mg (S/NS) over four attacks in adults with migraine. Patients were instructed to treat within 1 h of pain onset while pain was mild. Co-primary end-points were pain-free response at 2 h (2hPF) and 24-h sustained pain-free response (24hSPF) calculated as percentages of all attacks. In Study 1, 570 patients treated 1693 attacks with S/NS and 424 with placebo. In Study 2, 565 patients treated 1678 attacks with S/NS and 422 with placebo. Compared with placebo, S/NS conferred higher 2hPF rates (Study 1: S/NS 52%, placebo 25%; Study 2: S/NS 50%, placebo 20%; both P < 0.001) and higher 24hSPF rates (Study 1: S/NS 37%, placebo 17%; Study 2: S/NS 34%, placebo 12%; both P < 0.001). 2hPF was reported in at least two of the first three S/NS-treated attacks in 55.0% of patients in Study 1 and 52.1% of patients in Study 2. 24hSPF was reported in at least two of the first three S/NS-treated attacks in 35.7% of patients in Study 1 and 32.6% of patients in Study 2.

"Understanding the incretin pathway has led to significant advancements in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Still, the exact mechanisms are not fully understood. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, four-period, crossover study in 24 patients with T2D, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition and its glucose-lowering actions were tested after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The contribution of GLP-1 was examined by infusion of the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1r) antagonist exendin-9. DPP-4 inhibition reduced glycemia and enhanced insulin levels and the incretin effect (IE). Glucagon was suppressed, and gastric emptying (GE) was decelerated. Exendin-9 increased glucose levels and glucagon secretion, attenuated insulinemia and the IE, and accelerated GE. With the GLP-1r antagonist, the glucose-lowering effects of DPP-4 inhibition were reduced by â¼ 50%. However, a significant effect on insulin secretion remained during GLP-1r blockade, whereas the inhibitory effects of DPP-4 inhibition on glucagon and GE were abolished. Thus, in this cohort of T2D patients with a substantial IE, GLP-1 contributed â¼ 50% to the insulin excursion after an OGTT with and without DPP-4 inhibition. Thus, a significant DPP-4-sensitive glucose-lowering mechanism contributes to glycemic control in T2D patients that may be not mediated by circulating GLP-1.",

"The objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination artesunate (AS)/amodiaquine (AQ) therapy, and 2) to determine the difference between recrudescence and resistance. An in vivo efficacy study was conducted in Equatorial Guinea. A total of 122 children 6-59 months of age from two regional hospitals were randomized and subjected to a 28-day clinical and parasitological follow-up. A blood sample on Whatman paper was taken on Days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 or on any day in cases of treatment failure, with the parasite DNA then being extracted for molecular analysis purposes. A total of 4 children were excluded, and 9 cases were lost to follow-up. There were 17 cases of late parasitological failure, 3 cases of late clinical failure, and 89 cases of adequate clinical and parasitological response. The parasitological failure rate was 18.3% (20 of 109) and the success rate 81.70% (95% confidence interval [72.5-87.9%]). After molecular correction, real treatment efficacy stood at 97.3%.

"Transfusion-induced hemosiderosis is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication for some patients with sickle cell anemia. The use of high-dose intravenous deferoxamine (DFO) has become widespread in spite of a paucity of published data on safety and efficacy. We report a randomized double-blind study of the dose-response relationship of intravenous DFO in six subjects with sickle cell anemia and severe transfusion-induced hemosiderosis (serum ferritin 4100 to 14,176 ng/ml). Each subject received three different doses of intravenous DFO for 3 days each while consuming a constant diet. Total iron excretion (urine and fecal) was 91% greater at 180 mg/kg/day DFO than at 60 mg/kg/day DFO, and fecal iron excretion became a relatively larger proportion of total excretion at higher doses. Subsequent treatment for 3 months with 150 mg/kg/day DFO caused a 33% to 60% reduction in serum ferritin and demonstrable improvement in hepatic function in all patients. No toxicity was encountered, but DFO at 180 mg/kg/day was associated with a significant increase in fecal zinc excretion when compared with that observed at lower doses.",

Its goal was to compare the UNILAT generic product (latanoprost 50 microg/ml, eye drops solution, Unimed Pharma) with XALATAN original product (latanoprost 50 microg/ml, eye drops solution, Pfizer) and to prove that UNILAT is as effective and safe as original product. The study was performed on 77 subjects in seven private ophthalmic outpatient departments in Slovakia during the period from February 5, 2008 till July 24, 2008. The primary endpoint specified to prove UNILAT's efficacy was the average decrease of IOP measured between the first and last visit. The secondary endpoint was proportion of patients with measured IOP less than 21 mmHg at the end of the clinical trial. The safety of the generic product was based on the frequency of adverse reactions in subjects included in the study. Results of clinical study have confirmed UNILAT's therapeutical indications and demonstrated that it is non-inferior to the original product concerning efficacy and safety in the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension.",

"Calcineurin pathway plays the critical role in the cardiac remodeling of various origin, development of chambers dilatation and progression of heart failure. Components of calcineurin pathway are involved in myocardium hypertrophy regulation, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Results of quantitative expression profiling study of main calcineurin pathway genes PPP3CA, PPP3R1, PPP3CB, GATA4 and NFATC4 in myocardium of right atrium auricle of patients with a coronary heart disease, exposed to various types of surgical treatments depending on weight of a clinical finding (surgical reconstruction of the geometry of left ventricle (LV) (postinfarction aneurysm) or coronary artery bypass grafting in case of unaltered morphology of LV) are presented. In patients with sizable postinfarction LV dilatation (n = 21) expression level of calcineurin catalytic subunit genes PPP3CA and PPP3CB was 1.3 and 1.6 times lower (p = 0.018 and 0.023, accordingly) compared to patients with unaltered shape of the heart (n = 34). Expression level of PPP3R1 gene encoding calcineurin regulatory subunit B and GATA4 and NFATC4 genes for transcription factors did not differ in studied subgroups of patients. Thus, lower expression of PPP3CA and PPP3CB genes in atrium myocardium can be related to expressed postinfarction LV remodeling. Further studies of relation quantitative expression profiling of calcineurin pathway genes with the level of damage of myocardium is essential what may have important outcome for the prevention of adverse events of cardiosurgical treatments in patients with postinfarction remodeling.",

"The Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH) demonstrated the efficacy of hydroxyurea in reducing the rate of painful crises compared to placebo. We used resource utilization data collected in the MSH to determine the cost-effectiveness of hydroxyurea. The MSH was a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial involving 299 patients at 21 sites. The primary outcome, visit to a medical facility, was one of the criteria to define occurrence of painful crisis. Cost estimates were applied to all outpatient and emergency department visits and inpatient hospital stays that were classified as a crisis. Other resources for which cost estimates were applied included hospitalization for chest syndrome, analgesics received, hydroxyurea dosing, laboratory testing, and clinic visits for management of patient care. Annualized differential costs were calculated between hydroxyurea- and placebo-receiving patients. Hospitalization for painful crisis accounted for the majority of costs in both arms of the study, with an annual mean of $12,160 (95% CI: $9,440, $14,880) for hydroxyurea and $17,290 (95% CI: $13,010, $21,570) for placebo. The difference in means was $5,130 (95% CI: $60, $10,200; P = 0.048). Chest syndrome was the next largest cost with a mean difference of $830 (95% CI: $-340, $2,000; P = 0.16). The hydroxyurea arm was also associated with lower costs for emergency department visits, transfusion, and use of opiate analgesics. In total, the annual average cost per patient receiving hydroxyurea was $16,810 (95% CI: $13,350, $20,270) and the annual average costs per patient receiving placebo was $22,020 (95% CI: $17,340, $26,710). The difference in means was $5,210 (95% CI: $-610, $11,030; P = 0.21). The cost of hydroxyurea with the more intensive monitoring required when using this drug appears to be more than offset by decreased costs for medical care of painful crisis and analgesic use. Although the total cost difference was not significant statistically, these results suggest that hydroxyurea therapy is cost-effective compared to placebo in the management of adult patients with sickle cell anemia. If hydroxyurea can prevent development of chronic organ damage, long-term savings may be even greater.",

"To compare the efficacy, adverse effects, and patient compliance of latanoprost monotherapy with unfixed combination therapy with 0.5% timolol maleate and 1% dorzolamide in the treatment of chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma (CACG), 36 Japanese patients with CACG following laser iridotomy (LPI) were treated for 12 weeks with instillation of latanoprost alone or with unfixed combination therapy of 0.5% timolol maleate and 1% dorzolamide hydrochloride. After 12 weeks of treatment, latanoprost reduced intraocular pressure (IOP) from 22.2 +/- 2.0 mmHg to 14.8 +/- 1.9 mmHg (33% reduction); timolol maleate and dorzolamide hydrochloride also reduced IOP from 22.5 +/- 2.2 mmHg to 17.1 +/- 2.7 mmHg (24% reduction). Latanoprost monotherapy significantly lowered IOP compared with unfixed combination therapy of 0.5% timolol maleate and 1% dorzolamide hydrochloride. Furthermore, a systemic adverse effect of bradycardia was not observed in the latanoprost monotherapy group. Concerning compliance, no significant difference was observed between the two groups. Thus, latanoprost monotherapy is more effective than unfixed combination therapy with 0.5% timolol maleate and 1% dorzolamide in the treatment of CACG following relief of pupillary block in Japanese patients.",

"We described the spatiotemporal change of malaria (Plasmodium vivax) in Turkey over 34 years (1975-2008), and assessed the role of environmental variables in this change. We developed seven 5-year-period raster maps by using geo-referenced malaria case data from the centres of 81 provinces and the kriging method with a spherical variogram model in a geographic information systems (GIS) model. We also modelled malaria incidence in GIS by using our average malaria incidence raster map, and complementary spatial database including the raster map layers of 14 environmental variables. We chose linear regression analysis with backward method to investigate relationships among variables and develop a model. The model was run in GIS to obtain a model incidence raster map. We tested the reliability of the model map by residual statistics, and found the model map dependable. Five-year-period maps revealed that the distribution of malaria cases moved from the East Mediterranean region to the Southeast Anatolia region due to changing human activities. The latitude, minimum temperature, distance to seas and elevation variables were found to have significant impacts on malaria. Consequently, the model incidence map established a good background for early warning systems to predict epidemics of malaria following environmental changes.",

The most common adverse events were nausea, abdominal pain, headache and insomnia, many of which were mild in severity (30%; 60/203) and transient; 19% of subjects (39/203) experienced moderate (with some interference with daily duties requiring no or minimal medical therapy) adverse events. Two subjects (1%) had severe gastrointestinal adverse events requiring cessation of medication, but neither was seriously ill. Ten subjects (5%) had peripheral cyanosis (blueness of the lips), but none reported any respiratory compromise. These findings suggest that the short higher-dose PQ regimen is safe and well tolerated, which could improve PQ compliance and effectiveness.",

"Radiographs of the chest (CXR) were evaluated in 35 of 41 infants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of modified bovine surfactant extract (Surfactant-TA Tokyo-Tanabe) treatment. Infants between birthweight 1000 and 1500 gm with respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation and an inspired oxygen concentration 0.4 or greater were randomly assigned to either a single intratracheal dose of saline or surfactant-TA prior to 8 hours of age. Radiographs obtained prior to treatment and 24 hours after treatment were reviewed by a radiologist (N.T.G.) without knowledge of treatment group. Evaluation consisted of a score including criteria for inflation of the lungs, density of the lungs, and extent of air bronchograms. Pneumothorax, pulmonary interstitial emphysema, and asymmetric parenchymal involvement were noted as well. No significant difference in CXR scores were noted in the two groups, before or after treatment. There was a greater incidence of pneumothorax and pulmonary interstitial emphysema in the control infants, which supports the role of surfactant in preventing barotrauma. Increased incidence of asymmetric parenchymal involvement was noted in the surfactant-treated infants. Further study of the possibility of drug maldistribution is warranted.",
"Biomarkers for active tuberculosis (TB) are urgently needed. Mycobacteria produce membrane vesicles (MVs) that contain concentrated immune-modulatory factors that are released into the host. We evaluated the human immune responses to BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis MVs to characterize the antibody responses and identify potentially novel TB biomarkers. Serological responses to MVs were evaluated by ELISAs and immunoblots with sera from 16 sputum smear-positive, 12 smear-negative HIV uninfected pulmonary TB patients and 16 BCG vaccinated Tuberculin skin-test positive controls with and without latent tuberculosis infection. MVs from both BCG and M. tuberculosis induced similar responses and were strongly immunogenic in TB patients but not in controls. Several MV-associated antigens appear to induce robust antibody responses, in particular the arabinomanan portion of the cell wall glycolipid lipoarabinomannan. Three proteins at â 36, 25, and 23 kDa were simultaneously recognized by sera from 16/16 smear-positive, 9/12 smear-negative TB patients and 0/16 controls. These results provide promise and encouragement that antibody responses to proteins enriched in MVs of pathogenic mycobacteria may constitute a novel TB biomarker signature that could have diagnostic information.",
"The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of frovatriptan and almotriptan in women with menstrually related migraine (IHS Classification of Headache disorders) enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. Patients received frovatriptan 2.5Â mg or almotriptan 12.5Â mg in a randomized sequence: after treating 3 episodes of migraine in no more than 3Â months with the first treatment, the patient was switched to the other treatment. 67 of the 96 female patients of the intention-to-treat population of the main study had regular menstrual cycles and were thus included in this subgroup analysis. 77 migraine attacks classified as related to menses were treated with frovatriptan and 78 with almotriptan. Rate of pain relief at 2 and 4Â h was 36 and 53Â % for frovatriptan and 41 and 50Â % for almotriptan (pÂ =Â NS between treatments). Rate of pain free at 2 and 4Â h was 19 and 47Â % with frovatriptan and 29 and 54Â % for almotriptan (pÂ =Â NS). At 24Â h, 62Â % of frovatriptan-treated and 67Â % of almotriptan-treated patients had pain relief, while 60 versus 67Â % were pain free (pÂ =Â NS). Recurrence at 24Â h was significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) lower with frovatriptan (8 vs. 21Â % almotriptan). This was the case also at 48Â h (9 vs. 24Â %, pÂ <Â 0.05). Frovatriptan was as effective as almotriptan in the immediate treatment of menstrually related migraine attacks. However, it showed a more favorable sustained effect, as shown by a lower rate of migraine recurrence.",

"Felt prepared from polyglycolide (PGA) polymer fibers was pasted with fibrin glue for prevention of postoperative pulmonary fistula, and its effects were evaluated. The subjects were 90 patients who underwent thoracotomy and were expected to develop air leakage between March 1990 and the end of 1993. The felt sheet was simply pasted in position in 67 patients, applied and fixed by suturing in 7, and sutured and pasted in 16. The duration of air leakage in the three groups were 4.6 +/- 4.1, 3.9 +/- 4.9, and 3.2 +/- 3.8 days, respectively. According to the surgical procedure employed, the duration of air leakage was 5.0 +/- 4.0 days in 41 patients who underwent pulmonary lobectomy, 5.0 +/- 4.3 days in 5 patients who underwent segmentectomym, 2.6 +/- 3.1 days in 26 cases who underwent partial pneumonectomy, and 4.9 +/- 4.0 days in the 14 cases who underwent bulla resection. In terms of disease, the leakage time was 4.6 +/- 4.2 days in patients with emphysema, 0.6 +/- 1.2 days in those with diffuse pulmonary fibrosis, 0.7 +/- 0.9 days in those with Infectious disease, 4.8 +/- 4.2 in those with lung cancer, 1.5 +/- 1.5 days in those with benign lung tumor, and 3.8 +/- 2.7 days in those with metastatic lung tumors. The procedure had no side-effect on liver or kidney function. No infection was observed even after decortication for empyema. The use of felt prevented excessive shrinking of the lung due to over-suturing. Therefore, intraoperative application of a PGA felt sheet was considered to be an effective method for prevention of pulmonary fistula.",

"The Immediate Myocardial Metabolic Enhancement During Initial Assessment and Treatment in Emergency care Trial of very early intravenous glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in out-of-hospital emergency medical service (EMS) settings showed 80% reduction in infarct size at 30 days, suggesting potential longer-term benefits. Here we report 1-year outcomes. Prespecified 1-year end points of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, effectiveness trial included all-cause mortality and composites including cardiac arrest, mortality, or hospitalization for heart failure (HF). Of 871 participants randomized to GIK versus placebo, death occurred within 1 year in 11.6% versus 13.5%, respectively (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 1.23, p = 0.36). The composite of cardiac arrest or 1-year mortality was 12.8% versus 17.0% (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.02, p = 0.06). The composite of hospitalization for HF or mortality within 1 year was 17.2% versus 17.2% (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.37, p = 0.92). The composite of mortality, cardiac arrest, or HF hospitalization within 1 year was 18.1% versus 20.4% (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.16, p = 0.30). In patients presenting with suspected ST elevation myocardial infarction, HRs for 1-year mortality and the 3 composites were, respectively, 0.65 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.27, p = 0.21), 0.52 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.92, p = 0.03), 0.63 (95% CI 0.35 to 1.16, p = 0.14), and 0.51 (95% CI 0.30 to 0.87, p = 0.01). In patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes, serious end points generally were lower with GIK than placebo, but the differences were not statistically significant. However, in those with ST elevation myocardial infarction, the composites of cardiac arrest or 1-year mortality, and of cardiac arrest, mortality, or HF hospitalization within 1 year, were significantly reduced.",

"The effect of rate versus rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation who have undergone previous pacemaker (PM) implantation is unknown. We evaluated the mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation and a PM randomized to rate or rhythm control treatment strategies. The Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management data set was stratified by the presence (n = 250) or absence (n = 3,810) of a PM at randomization into the rate or rhythm control arm. Kaplan-Meier curves were used for univariate analysis, and proportional hazards were used for multivariate analysis. The subjects with a PM (n = 250) were older (73 vs 69 years, p <0.01) and had a greater prevalence of coronary artery disease (53% vs 37%, p <0.01) and congestive heart failure (33% vs 23%, p <0.01). All-cause mortality was significantly greater in the PM patients who were randomized to the rhythm control arm (n = 128) than in the patients enrolled in the rate control arm with or without a PM (n = 2,027, p <0.01) and those in the rhythm control arm without a PM (n = 1,905, p <0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that predictors of all-cause mortality included PM patients randomized to the rhythm control arm (hazard ratio 2.59, 95% confidence interval 1.46 to 4.58, p <0.01) and the presence of congestive heart failure (hazard ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 4.16, p <0.01). In conclusion, all-cause mortality was greater among patients with atrial fibrillation with a PM, who were randomized to the rhythm control arm of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management study compared with all other patients enrolled in the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management study. The rhythm control strategy in patients with a PM was an independent predictor of mortality.",

"Previous research suggests that a co-morbid relationship exists between migraine and endometriosis; however, results have been inconsistent. In addition, female hormones, which are important in the pathogenesis and management of endometriosis, have been reported to precipitate migraine attacks and may confound the results. The aim of this population-based cohort study was to explore the relationship between migraine and endometriosis in women of reproductive age (18-51 years). Data were derived from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, which contains outpatient and inpatient records from 2000 to 2007. Our study cohort included 20,220 endometriosis patients and 263,767 controls without endometriosis. We analyzed the prevalence of migraine in these women as recorded during the eight years of the database. Our results found that patients with endometriosis were more likely to suffer migraine headaches compared to controls (odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.59, 1.82]; p<0.001). In addition, the co-morbid association between migraine and endometriosis remained significant after the data were controlled for age and frequently utilized hormone therapies (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, [1.27, 1.47]; p<0.001). The results of this cohort study support the existence of a co-morbid relationship between migraine and endometriosis, even after adjusting for the possible effects of female hormone therapies on migraine attacks.",

"The malaria vaccine candidate, RTS,S/AS01(E), showed promising protective efficacy in a trial of Kenyan and Tanzanian children aged 5 to 17 months. Here we report on the vaccine's safety and tolerability. The experimental design was a Phase 2b, two-centre, double-blind (observer- and participant-blind), randomised (1â¶1 ratio) controlled trial. Three doses of study or control (rabies) vaccines were administered intramuscularly at 1 month intervals. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were collected for 7 days after each vaccination. There was surveillance and reporting for unsolicited adverse events for 30 days after each vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded throughout the study period which lasted for 14 months after dose 1 in Korogwe, Tanzania and an average of 18 months post-dose 1 in Kilifi, Kenya. Blood samples for safety monitoring of haematological, renal and hepatic functions were taken at baseline, 3, 10 and 14 months after dose 1. A total of 894 children received RTS,S/AS01(E) or rabies vaccine between March and August 2007. Overall, children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01(E) had fewer SAEs (51/447) than children in the control group (88/447). One SAE episode in a RTS,S/AS01(E) recipient and nine episodes among eight rabies vaccine recipients met the criteria for severe malaria. Unsolicited AEs were reported in 78% of subjects in the RTS,S/AS01(E) group and 74% of subjects in the rabies vaccine group. In both vaccine groups, gastroenteritis and pneumonia were the most frequently reported unsolicited AE. Fever was the most frequently observed solicited AE and was recorded after 11% of RTS,S/AS01(E) doses compared to 31% of doses of rabies vaccine. The candidate vaccine RTS,S/AS01(E) showed an acceptable safety profile in children living in a malaria-endemic area in East Africa. More data on the safety of RTS,S/AS01(E) will become available from the Phase 3 programme.",

"Exercise is assumed to have a positive effect on migraine. However, none of the few studies on this topic can prove the expected positive influence of exercise. Therefore, the aim of this pilot study was to develop a training program suitable for migraine patients and to examine its effect on migraine. 16 patients were examined. 8 migraine patients completed a 10-week aerobic running exercise program consisting of 3 workouts per week. The program was developed by sports scientists especially to increase the fitness level. Physical fitness, i.âe., physical working capacity, was assessed using a PWC 150 test. There was also a control group of 8 patients without any special physical training. Migraine patients of the exercise group showed both a reduction in the number of migraine days per month (p=0.048) and the intensity of the attacks (p=0.028). An increase in fitness level resulted in a lowered stress level. Stress strategies like "displacement activity" (r=-0.715; p=0.046), "looking for self-affirmation" (r=-0.742; p=0.035) and "feelings of aggression" (r=-0.802; p=0.017) were reduced. Increasing the level of fitness (PWC 150) is one predictor for migraine improvement (r=0.409, p=0.031). Aerobic exercise which leads to a better fitness level is an alternative therapy method for migraine.",
"Our analysis is based on data from AVERROES, a randomized double-blind trial testing the efficacy and safety of apixaban against aspirin for the prevention of thrombo-embolism in 5599 atrial fibrillation (AF) patients unsuitable for vitamin K antagonist therapy. Hospitalizations were captured by dedicated case report forms and the outcome variable was time from randomization to the first hospitalization. Effects of treatment with apixaban on the rates of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular hospitalizations were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. During a mean follow-up of 1.1 years, 800 patients were hospitalized at least once for cardiovascular reasons, 442 (15.4%/year) in the aspirin group, 358 (12.3%) in the apixaban group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.92; P = 0.002]. The reduction in cardiovascular hospitalization in the apixaban arm was predominantly due to a reduction in hospitalization for strokes, but there were also fewer hospitalizations for other cardiovascular causes. Patients with paroxysmal AF were significantly more likely to be hospitalized for AF treatment, whereas more heart failure admissions occurred in patients with permanent AF. Assignment to apixaban was the only independent predictor for a reduction in hospitalization. Cardiovascular hospitalization was the strongest independent predictor of subsequent mortality (HR: 3.95, 95% CI: 3.06-5.09; P < 0.001).",
"The study was undertaken to determine the safety and efficacy of NIPRISAN, a phytomedicine, developed for the management of patients with Sickle Cell Disorder (SCD). The study design is a placebo-controlled double blind cross-over trial. Eighty-two (82) patients with SCD were recruited and randomised into two groups. An initial 4 month pre-trial study was undertaken to determine the similarity of the groups. The main study was conducted over a twelve-month period with crossover at six months. Safety of the drug was assessed clinically and biochemically. NIPRISAN significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the frequency of SCD crisis associated with severe pains. Acute toxicity to the liver assessed by the activities of liver enzymes, indicate that NIPRISAN is safe. Renal function assessed by the serum levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen remained normal. Both the clinical and laboratory results of the present phase IIB (pivot) clinical study suggest that NIPRISAN is a safe and efficacious phytomedicine for the management of patients with Sickle Cell Disorder.",

"The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of migraine, alexithymia, and post-traumatic stress disorder among medical students at Cumhuriyet University of Sivas in Turkey. A total of 250 medical students participated in this study and answered the questionnaires. The study was conducted in three stages: the self-questionnaire, the neurological evaluation, and the psychiatric evaluation. In the first stage, the subjects completed a questionnaire to assess migraine symptoms and completed the three-item Identification of Migraine Questionnaire, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version Scale. The subjects who reported having a migraine underwent a detailed neurological evaluation conducted by a neurologist to confirm the diagnosis. In the final stage, the subjects with a migraine completed a psychiatric examination using the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV-R Axis I. The actual prevalence of migraine among these medical students was 12.6Â %. The students with a migraine were diagnosed with alexithymia and post-traumatic stress disorder more frequently than those without migraine. The Migraine Disability Assessment Scale scores correlated with the post-traumatic stress disorder scores. The results of this study indicate that migraine was highly prevalent among medical students in Turkey and was associated with the alexithymic personality trait and comorbid psychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder. Treatment strategies must be developed to manage these comorbidities.",
"Plasma concentrations were obtained from 9,183 patients, with 112 ischemic strokes/systemic emboli (1.3%) and 323 major bleeds (3.8%) recorded. Dabigatran levels were dependent on renal function, age, weight, and female sex, but not ethnicity, geographic region, ASA use, or clopidogrel use. A multiple logistic regression model (c-statistic 0.657, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61 to 0.71) showed that the risk of ischemic events was inversely related to trough dabigatran concentrations (p = 0.045), with age and previous stroke (both p < 0.0001) as significant covariates. Multiple logistic regression (c-statistic 0.715, 95% CI: 0.69 to 0.74) showed major bleeding risk increased with dabigatran exposure (p < 0.0001), age (p < 0.0001), ASA use (p < 0.0003), and diabetes (p = 0.018) as significant covariates.",
"ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (encoded by ABCB-1 or MDR-1) has an important role in cellular export of antiretroviral agents. A previous study showed that ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphism affects plasma efavirenz and nelfinavir concentrations and rate of CD4+ T cell recovery after starting antiretroviral treatment (ART). The present study examined the influence of ABCB-1 polymorphisms on plasma nevirapine and efavirenz levels when co-administered with rifampicin in 124 HIV/TB patients who received nevirapine- (400 mg/day) (n = 59) and efavirenz- (600 mg/day) (n = 65) based ART. ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphisms were genotyped using real-time PCR. CD4 T cell counts and HIV-1 viral RNA were evaluated in response to ART. The frequencies of CC, CT and TT genotypes of ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphism were 34% (n = 42), 55% (n = 68) and 12% (n = 14), respectively. Contrary to the previous report, no association was found among these genotypes and plasma drug concentrations at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and after rifampicin discontinuation. We also observed no differences in CD4+ T cell recovery rate among different ABCB-1 C3435T genotypes. In nevirapine group, however, all the patients with CT genotype achieved HIV-1 RNA levels of < 50 copies/ml, while 67% of those with TT and 95% with CC genotypes achieved < 50 copies/ml (p = 0.040). These data suggested that ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphisms do not affect plasma nevirapine and efavirenz concentrations in HIV/TB co-infected Thai patients or their immunological outcome, but had an effect on virologic outcome in the nevirapine-treated group.",

"RheothRx (Glaxo Wellcome Inc, Research Triangle Park, NC; poloxamer 188) Injection is a nonionic surfactant with hemorrheologic properties that suggest it may be useful in treating acute painful episodes (vasoocclusive crises) of sickle cell disease (SCD). We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of poloxamer, formulated as RheothRx Injection, in 50 patients with SCD. Patients with moderate to severe painful episodes requiring parenteral analgesics were randomized to receive a 48-hour infusion of either RheothRx or placebo. Pain was assessed every 4 hours. Efficacy endpoints included: (1) painful episode duration, (2) days of hospitalization, (3) quantity of analgesics used, and (4) pain intensity scores. Three subgroups of patients were considered for efficacy analyses based on the actual duration of the study drug infusion and the completeness of pain score data collection. Compared with placebo and depending on the subgroup, RheothRx-treated patients showed a 16% to 45% decrease in duration of painful episodes, a 1- to 2-day reduction in hospital stay, a threefold to fivefold reduction in analgesic requirements, and a 1-point reduction (using a 5-point scale) in average pain intensity scores at 72 hours. RheothRx was well tolerated; no clinically significant differences were observed between treatments with respect to adverse experiences or other safety measures. In addition, there were no differences between treatment groups in the incidence of recurrent painful episodes. In this study, RheothRx significantly reduced total analgesic use and pain intensity and showed trends to shorter duration of painful episodes and total days of hospitalization. In patients with moderate to severe vasoocclusive pain, RheothRx was safe and may offer a therapeutic benefit.",

"There is limited data on the efficacy of hydroxyurea (HU) in Indian sickle cell anemia patients who have severe manifestations despite high fetal hemoglobin (Hb F). Sixty sickle cell anemia children (5-18 years) with more than three episodes of vasoocclusive crises or blood transfusions per year were randomized to receive HU (n = 30) or placebo (n = 30) therapy. Fixed dose (10 mg/kg/day) of HU was administered for 18 months and the patients were followed-up monthly with clinical assessment and laboratory monitoring. In the HU group, hemoglobin (Hb) and Hb F levels increased significantly along with a significant decrease in the number of painful crises, blood transfusion requirements and hospitalizations compared to the placebo group. No major adverse events were observed in this study. In conclusion, low-fixed dose HU therapy was effective for the treatment of Indian sickle cell anemia children.

"Sixty patients (37 males, 23 females, age range 7 to 34 years) suffering from sickle cell disease were treated with pentoxifylline (1200 mg/day per os, Trental 400 t.i.d.) or placebo in a double-blind randomized study of six week duration. Observation of pain frequency, intensity and duration of pain events as well as determination of various laboratory and hematologic parameters were maintained on weekly or biweekly basis, respectively, throughout the study. At the end of the trial the number of patients (14) with pain periods and the number of pain events (57) and the mean duration of pain events (4.1 days) in the drug group were significantly better than in the placebo group with 25 patients with pain, 219 pain events and 8.8 days mean pain duration. Hematocrit, red cell count, hemoglobin and platelet aggregation showed slight but significant positive changes with no corresponding alteration with placebo. The over all assessment of the therapeutic response showed 21 clearly improved patients with pentoxifylline compared to 10 such patients with placebo (p less than 0.05).

"Few studies have investigated whether angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is a practical alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) for long-term use after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in real-world practice in the percutaneous coronary intervention era. We compared 5-year survival benefits of ACEI and ARB in patients with AMI registered in the Osaka Acute Coronary Insufficiency Study. Study subjects were divided into 3 groups: ACEI (nÂ = 4,425), ARB (nÂ = 2,158), or patients without either drug (nÂ =Â 2,442). A total of 661 deaths were recorded. Cox regression analysis revealed that treatment with either ACEI or ARB was associated with reduced 5-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58 to 0.83, p <0.001 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98, pÂ = 0.03, respectively). However, Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression analyses based on propensity score revealed that ACEI was associated with better survival than ARB from 2 to 5Â years after survival discharge (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.74, p <0.001). These findings were confirmed in a propensity score-matched population. In conclusion, treatment with ACEI was associated with better 5-year survival after AMI.",

"Recurrence after thoracoscopic surgery for primary spontaneous pneumothorax is a lingering problem, and many intraoperative methods to induce pleural symphysis have been introduced. We analyzed the effects of chemical pleurodesis during thoracoscopic procedures. Between August 2003 and July 2005, 141 patients among indicated surgical treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax in two hospitals of our institution allowed this prospective study. The patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups: thoracoscopic procedure only (group A, n=50), thoracoscopic procedure and pleurodesis with dextrose solution (group B, n=49), and thoracoscopic procedure and pleurodesis with talc-dextrose mixed solution (group C, n=42). There was no significant difference in demographic data among the three groups. The two groups that underwent intraoperative pleurodesis had significantly longer postoperative hospital stays (A/B/C: 2.50+/-1.85/4.49+/-2.10/6.00+/-2.58 days; p=0.001) and a higher incidence of postoperative fever (A/B/C: 10.0/22.45/52.38%; chi(2)= 21.598, p=0.00). No significant differences were found for recurrence rates or the number of postoperative days until chest tube removal. Therefore, the results of our study indicate that intraoperative chemical pleurodesis gives no additional advantage to surgery alone in deterring recurrence for patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Thus, the use of such scarifying agents in the operating room must be reconsidered.",

"Diabetes has been inconsistently associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and there is little direct evidence on the associations of glycemia levels with VTE. We used data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study to test the hypothesis that glycemia, as measured by hemoglobin A1c (A1c), is positively associated with VTE. Participants aged 45-64 years (n = 12,298) had A1c measured in 1990 and were followed for incident VTE (n = 345) through 2005. Because A1c is affected by diabetes treatment, analyses were stratified by history of diagnosed diabetes. Owing to evidence of non-linearity, we categorized A1c according to clinical cut-points: <5.7, 5.7-6.4, and â¥ 6.5% in those with no diagnosed diabetes; <7.0 and â¥ 7.0% in those with diagnosed diabetes. After adjustment for potential confounders, the hazard ratios (95% CIs) for VTE across increasing A1c categories were 1 (referent), 1.02 (0.77, 1.35) and 0.72 (0.41, 1.29) for those without diagnosed diabetes, and 1.30 (0.77, 2.17) and 1.41 (0.95, 2.09) for those with diagnosed diabetes. To explore the relation, we employed various models to adjust for potential confounding variables and modeled A1c as tertiles. We consistently found elevated hazard ratios in those with diagnosed diabetes, though the association was not statistically significant in every model. Hazard ratios in those without diagnosed diabetes were close to 1. In conclusion, our results are mildly suggestive that diagnosed diabetes and high levels of glucose, per se, may increase the risk of VTE. Elevated glucose was not related to VTE in those without diagnosed diabetes.",

"The objective of the present study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of vernakalant hydrochloride injection (RSD1235), a novel antiarrhythmic drug, for the conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter to sinus rhythm (SR). Patients with either AF or atrial flutter were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive vernakalant (n = 138) or placebo (n = 138) and were stratified by an arrhythmia duration of >3 hours to â¤7 days (short duration) and 8 to â¤45 days (long duration). The first infusion of placebo or vernakalant (3 mg/kg) was given for 10 minutes followed by a second infusion of placebo or vernakalant (2 mg/kg) 15 minutes later if the arrhythmia had not terminated. A total of 265 patients were randomized and received treatment. The primary end point was conversion of AF to SR for â¥1 minute within 90 minutes of the start of the drug infusion in the short-duration AF group. Of the 86 patients receiving vernakalant in the short-duration AF group, 44 (51.2%) demonstrated conversion to SR compared to 3 (3.6%) of the 84 in the placebo group (p <0.0001). The median interval to conversion of short-duration AF to SR in the responders given vernakalant was 8 minutes. Of the entire AF population (short- and long-duration AF), 47 (39.8%) of the 118 vernakalant patients experienced conversion of AF to SR compared to 4 (3.3%) of the 121 placebo patients (p <0.0001). Transient dysgeusia and sneezing were the most common adverse events in the vernakalant patients. One vernakalant patient who had severe aortic stenosis experienced hypotension and ventricular fibrillation and died. In conclusion, vernakalant demonstrated a rapid and high rate of conversion for short-duration AF and was well tolerated.",

"The effect of rate versus rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation who have undergone previous pacemaker (PM) implantation is unknown. We evaluated the mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation and a PM randomized to rate or rhythm control treatment strategies. The Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management data set was stratified by the presence (n = 250) or absence (n = 3,810) of a PM at randomization into the rate or rhythm control arm. Kaplan-Meier curves were used for univariate analysis, and proportional hazards were used for multivariate analysis. The subjects with a PM (n = 250) were older (73 vs 69 years, p <0.01) and had a greater prevalence of coronary artery disease (53% vs 37%, p <0.01) and congestive heart failure (33% vs 23%, p <0.01). All-cause mortality was significantly greater in the PM patients who were randomized to the rhythm control arm (n = 128) than in the patients enrolled in the rate control arm with or without a PM (n = 2,027, p <0.01) and those in the rhythm control arm without a PM (n = 1,905, p <0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed that predictors of all-cause mortality included PM patients randomized to the rhythm control arm (hazard ratio 2.59, 95% confidence interval 1.46 to 4.58, p <0.01) and the presence of congestive heart failure (hazard ratio 2.42, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 4.16, p <0.01). In conclusion, all-cause mortality was greater among patients with atrial fibrillation with a PM, who were randomized to the rhythm control arm of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management study compared with all other patients enrolled in the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management study. The rhythm control strategy in patients with a PM was an independent predictor of mortality.",

"Hydroxyurea (HU), a widely used cytostatic, has been given over a long period of time to 14 adult Caucasian compound heterozygotes for beta s and various beta-thalassaemia genes. All patients had severe pain crises and other complications prior to receiving the drug. After 4-8 weeks on high 'sub-toxic' doses of HU all patients responded with a multifold increase of fetal haemoglobin (HbF) and a marked increase of MCV and MCH; they also felt significantly better and ceased having pains or other complaints. Haematological toxicity was minimal and rapidly reversible. Follow-up of the patients has now exceeded 100 weeks and goes up to 180 weeks in two of them. Pain crises have never recurred. Maintenance of high levels of HBF requires continuous administration of high doses of HU; whenever the latter were decrease in various attempts to avoid potential long-term toxicity, the observed changes gradually faded. The effect of HU in HbS/beta-thalassaemia may be better than that reported for homozygous HbS disease because the synthesized gamma-chains not only inhibit the sickling process but they also neutralize the noxious effects of the excess alpha-chains and cut down the ineffective erythropoiesis of the patients.",

"There is considerable evidence suggesting that cytokines play important roles in pain and in mediating neurovascular inflammation associated with migraine headaches. Although consensus exists to recommend topiramate (TPM) for migraine prevention, the mechanism of action in this regard is unknown. We measured serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in 66 migraine patients. Of these patients, 23 (34.9%) were taking TPM for migraine, and 43 (65.1%) were not. The IL-6 levels were compared with those of healthy controls without migraine, from the population living in the same region. The mean IL-6 levels in migraine patients taking TPM and patients who did not were 67.06 +/- 92.09 pg/mL and 44.09 +/- 59.19 pg/mL, respectively (P > 0.05). The IL-6 levels were higher in the patients taking TPM. The IL-6 level in the controls was 8.60 +/- 7.36 pg/mL, which was significantly lower than the patient group using TPM (P = 0.001). Our results show that, although IL-6 may be involved in pain induction or inflammatory mechanisms of migraine attacks, the serum IL-6 level was not reduced in migraine patients receiving TPM therapy. In conclusion, we found high IL-6 levels in migraine patients both with and without TPM therapy, suggesting that high IL-6 levels during pain-free periods could be a conditioning factor, making patients more vulnerable to pain attacks in chronic migraine. Further studies investigating the possible mechanism of TPM in migraine are needed.",

"This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of resistance to second-line antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs and its association with resistance-related mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated in China. In the present study, we collected 380 isolates from a population-based study in China and tested the drug susceptibility to first- and selected second-line drugs. These results were compared with polymorphisms in the DNA sequences of genes associated with drug resistance and MIC values of the studied second-line drugs. Of 43 multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates, 13 showed resistance to fluoroquinolones or injectable second-line drugs (preextensively drug-resistant TB [pre-XDR-TB]), and 4 were resistant to both and thus defined as extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB). Age and previous TB therapy, including use of second-line drugs, were two independent factors associated with increased resistance to both first- and second-line drugs. Molecular analysis identified the most frequent mutations in the resistance-associated genes: D94G in gyrA (29.1%) and A1401G in rrs (30.8%). Meanwhile, all 4 XDR-TB isolates had a mutation in gyrA, and 3 of them carried the A1401G mutation in rrs. Mutations in gyrA and rrs were associated with high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones and the second-line injectable drugs. In addition to the identification of resistance-associated mutations and development of a rapid molecular test to diagnose the second-line drug resistance, it should be a priority to strictly regulate the administration of second-line drugs to maintain their efficacy to treat multidrug-resistant TB.",

"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the intraocular pressure (IOP) -lowering effect and safety of topical travoprost with sofzia and without benzalkonium chloride on Japanese patients with glaucoma. Topical travoprost (0.04%) was used on 39 glaucoma patients with no prior use of topical prostaglandin F2alpha analogues (Beginning group). The IOP, number of conjunctival follicules, degrees of conjunctival hyperemia, and degrees of superficial punctate keratitis (SPK, AD-classification) were determined at the beginning of the treatment and after 1 month and 3 months. 37 other patients who were using 0.005% topical latanoprost were switched to 0.04% topical travoprost and analyzed in the same way (Switched group). For the Beginning group, the IOP was significantly decreased after 3 months (p < 0.0001). The conjunctival follicule score was decreased significantly (p = 0.033). Both the SPK area score and density score for the cases with SPK at the baseline decreased significantly (p = 0.034 and p = 0.024). In the switched group, the IOP was not changed significantly at 3 months after the switch (p = 0.118). Both the conjunctival follicule and hyperemia score were significantly decreased at 3 month (p = 0.0074 and p = 0.0047). The SPK area score for the cases with SPK at the time of switch decreased significantly (p = 0.013). Travoprost with sofzia preservative had an equal effect in reducing the IOP as latanoprost. It had low toxicity on the ocular surface of Japanese glaucoma patients.",

"Sickle cell trait (HbAS) is known to be protective against Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but it is unclear when during the course of infection this protection occurs and whether protection is innate or acquired. To address these questions, a cohort of 601 children 1-10 years of age were enrolled in Kampala, Uganda, and followed for 18 months for symptomatic malaria and asymptomatic parasitemia. Genotyping was used to detect and follow individual parasite clones longitudinally within subjects. Children with HbAS were protected against the establishment of parasitemia, as assessed by the molecular force of infection at older but not younger ages (at 2 years of age: incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.16; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.62-2.19; P = .6; at 9 years of age: IRR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.87; P = .01), suggesting an acquired mechanism of protection. Once parasitemic, children with HbAS were less likely to progress to symptomatic malaria, with protection again being the most pronounced at older ages (at 2 years of age: relative risk [RR] = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.77-1.10; P = .3; at 9 years of age: RR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.91; P = .008). Conversely, the youngest children were best protected against high parasite density (at 2 years of age: relative density = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.10-0.54; P = .001; at 9 years of age: relative density = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.30-1.19; P = .14), suggesting an innate mechanism of protection against this end point.",

"Cervical spine tuberculosis is a rare infectious disease that is not yet discussed well regarding the optimal method of its management. This is a prospective study of a total of 29 patients with cervical spine tuberculosis with a mean follow-up of 14 months (range, 10-21); they were classified randomly into two groups: group I, patients who underwent anterior cervical decompression and fixation and followed by the anti-tuberculous medications (16 patients) and group II, patients who had conservative anti-tuberculous medications only without surgical intervention (13 patients). All patients had complete clinical assessments using Nurick scale and the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score for myelopathy and the visual analogue scale for assessment of cervical pain. We had also neuro-radiographic assessment (cervical spine X-ray and MRI) at the first presentation and at 3, 6, and 12 months later. At final follow-up, significant neurological improvement was demonstrated in both management approaches, more obvious in the surgical group. Cervical pain showed a statistically significant improvement (Pâ<â0.05) in surgical group rather than in conservatively treated group. In the surgical group, the mean Cobb angle showed a significant change from a preoperative mean of -3.1âÂ±â1.6Â° to postoperative mean of 16.6âÂ±â5.4Â°, significantly correlated to the improvement of cervical pain (Pâ=â0.004), while it was changed from a mean of -0.8âÂ±â2.2 to a mean of 9.2âÂ±â3.8 1 year after starting of medical treatment in group II.

During a median follow-up period of 890 days (interquartile range: 224 to 1,563 days), compared to FIRM-blinded therapy, patients receiving FIRM-guided ablation maintained higher freedom from AF after 1.2 Â± 0.4 procedures (median 1; interquartile range: 1 to 1) (77.8% vs. 38.5%, pÂ = 0.001) and a single procedure (p < 0.001) and higher freedom from all atrial arrhythmias (pÂ = 0.003). Freedom from AF was higher when ablation directly or coincidentally passed through sources than when it missed sources (p < 0.001).",
"A total of 809 patients with a median baseline CD4+ T-cell count of 77 per cubic millimeter and an HIV-1 RNA level of 5.43 log(10) copies per milliliter were enrolled. In the earlier-ART group, 12.9% of patients had a new AIDS-defining illness or died by 48 weeks, as compared with 16.1% in the later-ART group (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.8 to 8.1; P=0.45). Among patients with screening CD4+ T-cell counts of less than 50 per cubic millimeter, 15.5% of patients in the earlier-ART group versus 26.6% in the later-ART group had a new AIDS-defining illness or died (95% CI, 1.5 to 20.5; P=0.02). Tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was more common with earlier ART than with later ART (11% vs. 5%, P=0.002). The rate of viral suppression at 48 weeks was 74% and did not differ between the groups (P=0.38).",

"Cervical internal carotid artery (cICA) occlusion is a recognized cause of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in sickle cell disease (SCD), but the associated clinical and radiologic features are not well described. We reviewed data on cervical magnetic resonance angiography (cMRA) performed prospectively in 67 patients (55 children) for indications including transcranial Doppler (TCD) abnormalities, AIS, or previous AIS. cICA lesions were seen in 10 (15%) patients, including 4 of 7 patients presenting with AIS, and appear to have been missed on first presentation in 4 of 10 patients with previous AIS. Radiologic features in 7 patients were consistent with dissection. In 2 patients, there was strong clinical and radiologic evidence for thromboembolic AIS, and this was also considered possible in 4 other patients. Three of the 4 AIS patients were anticoagulated acutely, and the nontreated patient had recurrent, probably thromboembolic, AIS. TCD findings were variable, but in 4 patients there were high velocities in the cerebral vessels contralateral to the cICA stenosis. We suggest that all patients with AIS should have cMRA during acute evaluation to identify cICA occlusions that may require anticoagulation. Routine screening of children with SCD should also include evaluation of neck vessels by carotid Doppler followed by cMRA if a cervical vascular lesion is suspected.",

"The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and its risk factors in China remains unclear. This study examined TB incidence and relative risk factors in rural areas of China. Participants (n = 177,529) were recruited in Xiangtan County (in the central area of China) and in Danyang County (in the eastern area of China) in 2009 and a followed-up study was conducted for one year. The incidence density of pulmonary TB and smear-positive TB were 91.6 (95% CI: 78.7, 106.0) per 100,000 person-year and 36.7 (95% CI: 33.1, 52.4) per 100,000 person-year respectively in Xiangtan, and 47.3 (95% CI: 38.2, 57.5) per 100,000 person-year and 22.7 (95% CI: 16.5, 30.8) per 100,000 person-year in Danyang. The medical history of TB was associated with TB, with the relative risk (RR) of 7.00 (95% CI: 2.76, 17.18) in Xiangtan and that of 31.08 (95% CI: 13.22, 73.10) in Danyang. The association between TB and per capita living space over median was found in Xiangtan, with the RR of 1.86 (95% CI: 1.15, 3.01). No association was found between TB and the insurance status, the contact history with TB, the history of diabetes, smoking, or per capita annual income. The host genetic susceptibility, and social factors such as education and income could be considered in future studies.",

"The purpose of the study was to investigate whether early high-dose potent statin therapy in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention can reduce infarct size compared with conventional low-dose statin therapy. In a randomized placebo-controlled multicenter trial, 185 patients were assigned either to an early high-dose rosuvastatin group (nÂ = 92, rosuvastatin 40Â mg before treatment plus maintenance for 7Â days) or to a conventional low-dose rosuvastatin group (nÂ = 93, placebo before treatment plus rosuvastatin 10-mg maintenance for 7Â days). Serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed during the acute (3 to 7Â days) and chronic (3Â months) phases. The primary end point was relative infarct volume assessed by MRI at 3Â months. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups, except hypertension, which was more prevalent in the high-dose group. Serial MRI data were available for 121 patients (high-dose group nÂ = 54 and low-dose group nÂ = 67). The relative infarct volumes in the acute (23.0 Â± 9.5% vs 20.5 Â± 11.7%, pÂ = 0.208) and chronic (15.9 Â± 8.3% vs 15.8 Â± 9.7%, pÂ = 0.943) phases were not different between the groups. No differences between groups were observed for periprocedural microvascular circulation evaluated by Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade, myocardial blush grade, ST-segment resolution, microvascular obstruction on cardiac MRI, or clinical outcomes. In conclusion, early high-dose rosuvastatin therapy in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention did not improve periprocedural myocardial perfusion or reduce infarct volume measured by MRI compared with the conventional low-dose rosuvastatin regimen.",

"The aim of this work was speciation analysis of metabolites in feces samples collected within a clinical study during which a bromine-containing anti-tuberculosis drug (TMC207) was administered to patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis infection. Owing to slow elimination of the drug, no (14)C label was used within this study. Quantification of the bromine species was accomplished using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC/ICP-MS) in combination with on-line isotope dilution (on-line ID), while structural elucidation of the species was performed using HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The ICP-MS-based method developed shows a good intra- and inter-day reproducibility (relative standard deviation = 3.5%, N = 9); the limit of detection (1.5 mg TMC207 L(-1)) is of the same order of magnitude as that for HPLC/radiodetection; the dynamic range of the method covers more than two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the column recovery was demonstrated to be quantitative (recoveries between 90.6% and 99.5%). Based on the excellent figures of merit, the "cold" HPLC/ICP-MS approach could be deployed for the actual human in vivo metabolism study, such that exposure of the human volunteers to the (14)C radiolabel was avoided.",

"Dabigatran is a direct thrombin inhibitor, does not require blood coagulation monitoring and limitation of vitamin K intake as well as very few drug interactions, and thus expected to be an oral anticoagulant alternative to warfarin. Randomized Evaluation of Long Term Anticoagulant Therapy (RE-LY) was conducted to determine non-inferiority of dabigatran against warfarin as an international multicenter-cooperative randomized trial in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). The results showed not only non-inferiority of dabigatran but also superiority of high-dose dabigatran in efficacy and of low-dose dabigatran in safety. In a sub-analysis of RE-LY in NVAF patients with history of stroke or TIA, who are at high risk of intracranial hemorrhage with anticoagulants, hemorrhagic stroke was much less frequent in patients on either dose of dabigatran than in those on warfarin. In a sub-analysis of RE-LY in Japanese patients with NVAF, the results showed a consistency of the efficacy and safety profiles of dabigatran with the results of the global RE-LY trial. Use of dabigatran should be contraindicated in NVAF patients with renal insufficiency because some cases with fatal bleeding have been reported in a post marketing survey.",
"In this study we assessed, by simultaneous recordings of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and pattern-electroretinograms (PERGs), the effects cytidine-5'-diphosphocholine (citicoline) on retinal function and/or visual cortical responses in glaucoma patients. Thirty glaucoma patients were randomly divided into two age-matched groups: patients in group GC (15 patients) were treated with citicoline (1,000 mg/die intramuscularly) for 2 months; patients in group GP (15 patients) were treated with placebo for 2 months. After 4 months of wash-out (month 6), GC patients underwent a further 2-month period of citicoline treatment (months 7-8) followed by another 4-month period of wash-out (months 9-12). In GP patients the wash-out was extended for a further 6 months (months 7-12). During the following 13-96 months, GC patients received additional 2-month periods of treatment with citicoline (each period followed by 4 months of wash-out) for a total of 16 periods in 8 years. GP patients were also examined at months 24, 26, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96. In GC patients the first two treatments with citicoline induced a significant (p <0.01) improvement of VEP and PERG parameters with respect to pre-treatment conditions. VEPs and PERGs recorded in GC patients after the first wash-out revealed that, although there was a worsening trend, the electrophysiological improvement was still maintained with respect to baseline conditions. The additional periods of citicoline treatment in GC patients during the subsequent 13-96 months induced a greater (p <0.01) improvement of VEP and PERG parameters with respect to pre-treatment conditions and when compared to GP patients. Thus, we observed that citicoline significantly improves retinal and cortical bioelectrical responses in glaucoma patients, suggesting a potential use of this substance in the medical treatment of glaucoma, as a complement to hypotensive therapy.",

"During atrial fibrillation (AF), multiple wandering propagation wavelets at high rates drift around both atria under controversial hierarchical models. Antiarrhythmic drugs modify the cardiac ionic currents supporting the fibrillation process within the atria, and can alter AF propagation dynamics and even terminate the arrhythmia. However, some other drugs, theoretically nonantiarrhythmic, may slightly block particular cardiac ionic currents through uncertain mechanisms in such a subtle way at regular heart rates that may have been pharmacologically overlooked. These potential effects might be better exposed at much higher activation rates as in AF, where atrial cells depolarize over 400 times per second. In this review, we aimed to compile and discuss results from several studies evaluating the net effect of profound sedation with propofol on atrial cells and atrioventricular (AV) conduction. Propofol is a very commonly used anesthetic agent, and its possible effect on AF dynamics has systematically not been taken into account in the myriad of clinical studies dealing with AF intracardiac recordings. The possible effect of sedation with propofol on AF was evaluated through the analysis of AF propagation patterns before and after its infusion in a series of patients submitted to pulmonary vein ablation. Effect on AV conduction will be discussed as well.",

"High levels of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) protect from many of the complications of sickle cell disease and lead to improved survival. Butyrate and other short chain fatty acids were previously shown to increase Hb F production in erythroid cells in vitro and in animal models in vivo. However, butyrates are also known to inhibit the proliferation of many cell types, including erythroid cells. Experience with the use of butyrate in animal models and in early clinical trials demonstrated that the Hb F response may be lost after prolonged administration of high doses of butyrate. We hypothesized that this loss of response may be a result of the antiproliferative effects of butyrate. We designed a regimen consisting of intermittent or pulse therapy in which butyrate was administered for 4 days followed by 10 to 24 days with no drug exposure. This pulse regimen induced fetal globin gene expression in 9 of 11 patients. The mean Hb F in this group increased from 7.2% to 21.0% (P <.002) after intermittent butyrate therapy for a mean duration of 29.9 weeks. This was associated with a parallel increase in the number of F cells and F reticulocytes. The total hemoglobin levels also increased from a mean of 7.8 g/dL to a mean of 8.8 g/dL (P <.006). The increased levels of Hb F were sustained in all responders, including 1 patient who has been on pulse butyrate therapy for more than 28 months. This regimen, which resulted in a marked and sustained increase in Hb F levels in more than two thirds of the adult sickle cell patients enrolled in this study, was well tolerated without adverse side effects. These encouraging results require confirmation along with an appropriate evaluation of clinical outcomes in a larger number of patients with sickle cell disease.",

Safety was assessed by recording ablation-related complications. Complete ablation was defined as a lack of enhancement within the ablation zone on follow-up computed tomography. No serious adverse sequelae were observed. Complete ablation was achieved in six of seven metastases (mean follow-up, 12.3 months; range, 2.5-28 months).

"Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has insulin-like effects on myocardial glucose uptake which may contribute to its beneficial effects in the setting of myocardial ischemia. Whether these effects are different in the setting of obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2DM) requires investigation. We examined the cardiometabolic actions of GLP-1 (7-36) in lean and obese/T2DM humans, and in lean and obese Ossabaw swine. GLP-1 significantly augmented myocardial glucose uptake under resting conditions in lean humans, but this effect was impaired in T2DM. This observation was confirmed and extended in swine, where GLP-1 effects to augment myocardial glucose uptake during exercise were seen in lean but not in obese swine. GLP-1 did not increase myocardial oxygen consumption or blood flow in humans or in swine. Impaired myocardial responsiveness to GLP-1 in obesity was not associated with any apparent alterations in myocardial or coronary GLP1-R expression. No evidence for GLP-1-mediated activation of cAMP/PKA or AMPK signaling in lean or obese hearts was observed. GLP-1 treatment augmented p38-MAPK activity in lean, but not obese cardiac tissue. Taken together, these data provide novel evidence indicating that the cardiometabolic effects of GLP-1 are attenuated in obesity and T2DM, via mechanisms that may involve impaired p38-MAPK signaling.",

"We conducted a multicenter, prospective, noncrossover, randomized study to determine whether high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) would decrease the development or progression of air leak syndrome in infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome. Air leak syndrome was defined as pulmonary interstitial emphysema or gross air leak such as pneumothorax. Infants were eligible for study entry if they were less than 48 hours of age and had severe respiratory distress syndrome, defined by peak inspiratory pressure or the presence of air leak syndrome. Infants who weighed > or = 0.5 kg at birth were randomly assigned to receive either conventional ventilation (CV) or HFOV. HFOV was provided by a ventilator that operated at 15 Hz, with a 1:2 inspiratory/expiratory ratio and no background tidal breaths. Severity of pulmonary interstitial emphysema was scored independently by two neonatologists unaware of the infants' ventilatory group. Gross air leak severity was scored according to the number of chest tubes required and duration of air leak. Eighty-six infants received HFOV; 90 received CV. During the first 24 hours of the study, patients in the HFOV group received significantly higher mean airway pressure and lower inspired oxygen concentration, had significantly lower arterial carbon dioxide tension, and had a higher ratio of arterial to alveolar oxygen tension. When the HFOV and CV groups were compared with control for birth weight strata, study site, and inborn versus outborn status, HFOV significantly reduced the development of air leak syndrome in those patients who entered the study without the syndrome. We conclude that HFOV, when the strategy employed in this study is used, provides effective ventilation, improves oxygenation, and significantly reduces the development of air leak syndrome in infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome.",

"In 13.4 months of follow-up, safety endpoints were equivalent between groups. At 1 year, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that CDC-treated patients had smaller scar size compared with control patients. Scar mass decreased and viable mass increased in CDC-treated patients but not in control patients. The single patient infused 14 months post-MI responded similarly. CDC therapy led to improved regional function of infarcted segments compared with control patients. Scar shrinkage correlated with an increase in viability and with improvement in regional function. Scar reduction correlated with baseline scar size but not with a history of temporally remote MI or time from MI to infusion. The changes in left ventricular ejection fraction in CDC-treated subjects were consistent with the natural relationship between scar size and ejection fraction post-MI.",

We enrolled 41 patients; 20 in the active and 21 in the control group. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age, procedural duration, extracorporeal circulation time, and aortic cross-clamp time. Mean time of conversion was significantly shorter in the active group (19.9 Â± 3.2 vs 37.2 Â± 3.9 hours, P < .001), suggesting that compared to amiodarone alone, the ranolazine-amiodarone combination had a superior antiarrhythmic effect against POAF.",
"This chapter provides a set of indicators on incident patients starting renal replacement therapy (RRT) in France between the 1st of January 2011 and the 31(st) of December 2011. Even if End-Stage Renal Disease can be found in all classes of ages, elders provide the majority of new patients (median age at RRT start: 71 years old). Those patients present a high rate of disabilities especially diabetes (41% of the new patients) and cardiovascular disabilities (>50% of the new patients) that increase with age. Considering treatment and follow-up, the first treatment remains center's hemodialysis and we do not notice any progression of self-dialysis. RRT started in emergency in 33% of the patients. This finding contrasts with the fact that 56% of patients started hemodialysis on a catheter. This, together with the major interregion variability, suggests that different strategies of management exist. Finally, the hemoglobin level at RRT start seems to be an interesting indicator of good management and follow-up since 13% of patients presenting an underprovided follow-up have a hemoglobin level under 10g/dL, whereas only 2.5% of patients with an appropriate follow-up presented such a condition.",

"The aim of this 6-month, prospective, multicenter study of 398 children and adolescents with primary headaches was to collect data on headache treatment in neuropediatric departments. Treatments were compared before and after consultation. Prior to consultation, the acute treatments that had been prescribed most frequently were paracetamol (82.2% of children) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs treatment (53.5%); 10.3% had received a prophylactic treatment. No differences in either acute or prophylactic treatment with respect to headache diagnosis were observed. After the neuropediatric consultation, paracetamol was replaced by a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug in about three-quarters of cases and by triptan in about one-quarter of cases. The number of children prescribed a prophylactic treatment nearly doubled, whereas there was a 5-fold and 23-fold increase in psychotherapy and relaxation training, respectively, between pre-referral and referral. We conclude that specific treatments were underused for primary headache.",

"Much of our knowledge about the characteristics, clinical management, and postdischarge outcomes of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is derived from clinical studies in middle-aged and older subjects with little contemporary information available about the descriptive epidemiology of AMI in relatively young men and women. The objectives of our population-based study were to describe >3-decade-long trends in the clinical features, treatment practices, and long-term outcomes of young adults aged 35 to 54Â years discharged from the hospital after AMI. The study population consisted of 2,142 residents of the Worcester (Massachusetts) metropolitan area who were hospitalized with AMI at all central Massachusetts medical centers during 16 annual periods from 1975 to 2007. Our primarily male study population had an average age of 47Â years. Patients hospitalized during the most recent decade (1997 to 2007) under study were more likely to have a history of hypertension and heart failure than those hospitalized during earlier study years. Patients were less likely to have developed heart failure or stroke during their hospitalization in the most recent compared with the initial decade under study (heart failure 13.7% and stroke 0.7% vs 20.9% and 2.0%, respectively). One- and 2-year postdischarge death rates also decreased significantly between 1975 to 1986 (6.2% and 9.0%, respectively) and 1988 to 1995 (2.6% and 4.9%). These trends were concomitant with the increasing use of effective cardiac therapies and coronary interventions during hospitalization. The present results provide insights into the changing characteristics, management, and improving long-term outcomes of relatively young patients hospitalized with AMI.",

"The mechanisms responsible for the remarkable remission of type 2 diabetes after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) are still puzzling. To elucidate the role of the gut, we compared Î²-cell function assessed during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and an isoglycemic intravenous glucose clamp (iso-IVGC) in: 1) 16 severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes, up to 3 years post-RYGBP; 2) 11 severely obese normal glucose-tolerant control subjects; and 3) 7 lean control subjects. Diabetes remission was observed after RYGBP. Î²-Cell function during the OGTT, significantly blunted prior to RYGBP, normalized to levels of both control groups after RYGBP. In contrast, during the iso-IVGC, Î²-cell function improved minimally and remained significantly impaired compared with lean control subjects up to 3 years post-RYGBP. Presurgery, Î²-cell function, weight loss, and glucagon-like peptide 1 response were all predictors of postsurgery Î²-cell function, although weight loss appeared to be the strongest predictor. These data show that Î²-cell dysfunction persists after RYGBP, even in patients in clinical diabetes remission. This impairment can be rescued by oral glucose stimulation, suggesting that RYGBP leads to an important gastrointestinal effect, critical for improved Î²-cell function after surgery.",

"Anemia, a common comorbidity in older adults with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), is associated with worse outcomes. The authors quantified the effect of anemia treatment on left ventricular (LV) structure and function as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. A prospective, randomized single-blind clinical trial (NCT NCT00286182) comparing the safety and efficacy of epoetin alfa vs placebo for 24 weeks in which a subgroup (n=22) had cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline and after 3 and 6 months to evaluate changes in cardiac structure and function. Pressure volume (PV) indices were derived from MRI measures of ventricular volume coupled with sphygmomanometer-measured pressure and Doppler estimates of filling pressure. The end-systolic and end-diastolic PV relations and the area between them as a function of end-diastolic pressure, the isovolumic PV area (PVAiso), were calculated. Patients (75Â±10 years, 64% women) with HFPEF (EF=63%Â±15%) with an average hemoglobin of 10.3Â±1.1 gm/dL were treated with epoetin alfa using a dose-adjusted algorithm that increased hemoglobin compared with placebo (P<.0001). As compared with baseline, there were no significant changes in end-diastolic (-7Â±8 mL vs -3Â±8 mL, P=.81) or end-systolic (-0.4Â±2 mL vs -0.7Â±5 mL, P=.96) volumes at 6-month follow-up between epoetin alfa compared with placebo. LV function as measured based on EF (-1.5%Â±1.6% vs -2.6%Â±3.3%, P=.91) and pressure volume indices (PVAiso-EDP at 30 mm Hg, -5071Â±4308 vs -1662Â±4140, P=.58) did not differ between epoetin alfa and placebo.

"We analyzed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2002 to 2010 to examine the temporal trends in incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), AKI requiring dialysis, and associated in-hospital mortality in patients â¥75 years of age hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction and undergoing early (within 24 hours) percutaneous coronary intervention. Of 2,225,707 patients â¥75 years of age with acute myocardial infarction, 233,508 (10.5%) underwent early percutaneous coronary intervention, of which 21,961 (9.4%) developed AKI and 1,257 (0.54%) developed AKI requiring dialysis. From 2002 to 2010, the incidence of AKI increased from 5.6% to 14.2% (p for trend <0.001) and that for AKI requiring dialysis decreased (0.6% to 0.4%; p for trend 0.018). Compared with 2002, multivariable-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for AKI, AKI requiring dialysis, and in-hospital mortality in 2010 were 1.87 (1.71 to 2.05), 0.20 (0.15 to 0.27) and 0.74 (0.60 to 0.90), respectively. In conclusion, among hospitalized adults â¥75 years of age, from 2002 to 2010, there was an increase in AKI, but there was paradoxical decrease in AKI requiring dialysis and in-hospital mortality, potentially reflecting increased health-care provider awareness resulting in early recognition and implementation of renal-protective strategies and diagnosis-related group creep.",

"Provoking delayed migraine with nitroglycerin in migraine sufferers is a cumbersome model. Patients are difficult to recruit, migraine comes on late and variably and only 50-80% of patients develop an attack. A model using normal volunteers would be much more useful, but it should be validated by testing the response to drugs of known efficacy in acute migraine. Furthermore, treatment during headache rather than pretreatment is the most naturalist method. To fulfil these requirements we used continuous long-lasting infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) 0.2 microg kg-1 min-1 for 140 min and gave aspirin 1000 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg or placebo to normal healthy volunteers. The design was double-blind, placebo-controlled three-way crossover. Our hypothesis was that these drugs would be effective in the treatment of the mild constant headache induced by long-lasting GTN infusion. The headaches did not fulfil the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura. Moreover, there was no effect on headache of either zolmitriptan or aspirin. Thus our hypothesis was disproved and we conclude that our model is not valid for the testing of new acute antimigraine drugs. Our experiment suggests that headache caused by direct nitric oxide (NO) action in the continued presence of NO is very resistance to analgesics and to specific acute migraine treatments. This suggests that NO works very deep in the cascade of events associated with vascular headache, whereas tested drugs work higher in the cascade. The model suggested here should therefore be tested with other headache/migraine-provoking agents that supposedly work higher in the cascade of events. The need for human models persists, but the solution to this problem is still pending.",
"The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients on chronic warfarin therapy due to atrial fibrillation (AF). We analysed all consecutive AF patients (N = 377, mean age 70 years, male 71%) on warfarin therapy referred for PCI in seven centres. Major bleeding, access site complications and major adverse cardiovascular events were recorded during hospitalisation. A total of 111 patients (29%) received periprocedural GPIs with a wide inter-hospital variation in their use (range 3-68%). The use of GPIs increased with the severity of the disease presentation and 49% of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction received GPIs. Mean periprocedural international normalised ratio (INR) of patients who received GPIs was 1.89 (range 1.1-3.3). Major bleeding was more common in the patients treated with GPIs (9.0% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.001) than in those without GPIs, but there was no difference in major adverse cardiovascular events between the groups. In multivariable analysis, use of GPIs (odds ratio [OR] 5.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-20.6, p = 0.02) and old age (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.3, p= 0.02) remained as the only independent predictors of major bleeding. Also after adjusting for propensity score, GPIs remained as a significant predictor of major bleeding (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.03-14.1, p = 0.045). In the GPI group, major bleeding was not predicted by INR level or warfarin pause. GPIs increase the risk of major bleeding events irrespective of periprocedural INR levels and should be used with caution in this fragile patient group.",

"The renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure via angiotensin II and the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R). Human AT1R gene promoter has four SNPs: T/A at -777, T/G at -680, A/C at -214, and A/G at -119, that are in linkage disequilibrium.

Myocardial perfusion was evaluated by myocardial blush grade and ST segment resolution. Follow-up data were collected within 1 year after primary angioplasty. Hypertension was observed in 700 patients (42.1%). Hypertension was associated with more advanced age (pÂ <0.001), female gender (p <0.001), diabetes (p <0.001), hypercholesterolemia (p <0.001), previous revascularization (p <0.001), anterior myocardial infarction (pÂ = 0.006), longer ischemia time (pÂ = 0.03), more extensive coronary artery disease (pÂ = 0.002), more often treated with abciximab (p <0.001), and less often smokers (p <0.001). Hypertension was associated with impaired postprocedural myocardial blush grade 2 to 3 (68.2% vs 74.2%, pÂ = 0.019) and complete ST segment resolution (51.7% vs 61.1%, pÂ = 0.001). By a mean follow-up of 206 Â± 158 days, 70 patients (4.3%) had died. Hypertension was associated with a greater mortality (6.2% vs 2.9%, hazard ratio 2.31, 95% confidence interval 1.42 to 3.73, pÂ <0.001), confirmed after correction for baseline confounding factors (hazard ratio 1.82, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 3.22, p <0.001). In conclusion, this study showed that among patients with STEMI undergoing primary angioplasty, hypertension is associated with impaired reperfusion and independently predicts 1-year mortality.",
"L-Arginine may be a conditionally essential amino acid in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease, particularly as required substrate in the arginine-nitric oxide pathway for endogenous nitrovasodilation and vasoprotection. Vasoprotection by arginine is mediated partly by nitric oxide-induced inhibition of endothelial damage and inhibition of adhesion and activation of leukocytes. Activated leukocytes may trigger many of the complications, including vasoocclusive events and intimal hyperplasias. High blood leukocyte counts during steady states in the absence of infection are significant laboratory risk factors for adverse complications. L-Citrulline as precursor amino acid was given orally twice daily in daily doses of approximately 0.1 g/kg in a pilot Phase II clinical trial during steady states in four homozygous sickle cell disease subjects and one sickle cell-hemoglobin C disease patient (ages 10-18). There soon resulted dramatic improvements in symptoms of well-being, raised plasma arginine levels, and reductions in high total leukocyte and high segmented neutrophil counts toward or to within normal limits. Continued L-citrulline supplementation in compliant subjects continued to lessen symptomatology, to maintain plasma arginine concentrations greater than control levels, and to maintain nearly normal total leukocyte and neutrophil counts. Side effects or toxicity from citrulline were not experienced. Oral L-citrulline may portend very useful for palliative therapy in sickle cell disease. Placebo-controlled, long-term trials are now indicated.",

"Despite progress in management, patients with sickle cell disease who are experiencing acute painful episode are often incompletely treated. We compared meperidine and tramadol with respect to their effects on the hemodynamics and pain relief in patients with sickle cell disease who were admitted to the emergency department with painful crisis. A total of 68 patients with sickle cell disease were randomly assigned to receive either tramadol 1.5 mg/kg (n = 34) or meperidine 1 mg/kg (n = 34). Hemodynamic parameters were recorded at regular intervals after analgesic infusions. Pain intensity and relief were documented by visual analog and pain relief scale, respectively. Sedation level was defined according to Ramsay sedation scale. Both meperidine and tramadol administration resulted in a significant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 2 hours (P < .05). Efficacy in pain relief between the analgesics was more rapid and better in the meperidine group, although the degree of relief were significantly improved compared to baseline levels in both groups (P < .05). Sedation was more commonly seen in the meperidine arm. None of the patients had experienced neurotoxicity. In summary, both agents had proven safe and effective for emergent use in patients with sickle cell disease. Avoiding meperidine injections as recommended with previous guidelines needs to be carefully reconsidered especially when low doses are mentioned.",

"The role that atrial pacing therapy plays on the atrial fibrillation (AF) burden is still unclear. Aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of the atrial preference pacing algorithm on AF burden in patients affected by Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1) followed for a long follow up period. Sixty DM1 patients were -implanted with a dual chamber pacemaker (PM) for first degree or symptomatic type 1/type 2 second degree atrio-ventricular blocks- were followed for 2-years after implantation, by periodical examination. After 1 month of stabilization, they were randomized into two groups: 1) Patients implanted with conventional dual-chamber pacing mode (DDDR group) and 2) Patients implanted with DDDR plus Atrial Preference Pacing (APP) algorithm (APP ON group). The results showed that atrial tachycardia (AT)/AF burden was significantly reduced at 1 year follow up in the APP ON group (2122 Â± 428 minutes vs 4127 Â± 388 minutes, P = 0.03), with a further reduction at the end of the 2 year follow up period (4652 Â± 348 minutes vs 7564 Â± 638 minutes, P = 0.005). The data here reported show that the APP is an efficient algorithm to reduce AT/AF burden in DM1 patients implanted with dual chamber pacemaker.",

"In a large retail business group the ID Migraine Screening Test was sent to employees with three or more absences from work in the past year (n = 2893). Employees with positive results were invited for a neurological consultation and migraine patients were randomly assigned to: first attack 'treated as usual' and the second attack treated with 40 mg eletriptan, or reversed order. Of the 2893 employees, 799 responded (28%), 260 were positively screened for migraine (33%), 84 patients were diagnosed by a neurologist and 41 of the 75 included patients completed the protocol. Eletriptan induced pain-free response in 33.3% of the patients at 4 h compared with 0% after 'non-specific' treatment (P = 0.03). Eletriptan also significantly improved quality of life, but differences in absence from work and productivity loss could not be detected. In conclusion, in-company screening can be beneficial for undertreated employees, but implementation obstacles can reduce the effectiveness of screening.",
"The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrollment of 252 patients because of an excess of thromboembolic and bleeding events among patients in the dabigatran group. In the as-treated analysis, dose adjustment or discontinuation of dabigatran was required in 52 of 162 patients (32%). Ischemic or unspecified stroke occurred in 9 patients (5%) in the dabigatran group and in no patients in the warfarin group; major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (4%) and 2 patients (2%), respectively. All patients with major bleeding had pericardial bleeding.",
"The efficiency of malaria prevention during pregnancy was compared between three studies in Benin for malaria infection of the placenta (MIP) and low birth weight (LBW). The first was carried out when chloroquine prophylaxis was still recommended, the second was an intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) clinical trial comparing sulfadoxine pyrimetamine (SP) versus mefloquine, and the third was an observational study after SP-IPTp national implementation. We showed an association between the use of IPTp and the reduction of LBW (10% with national IPTp and 8.7% in IPTp trial versus 15.7% in pre-trial study). The effect on MIP was better in the trial (2.9% versus 11.2% and 16.7% for national IPTp and pre-trial studies, respectively). In spite of a good overall compliance with the national IPTp (with 84% of women taking at least one dose of SP), there are still failures in adherence to the directly observed therapy (DOT) scheme and needs for better training of health staff.",
"2,2-Dimethylbutyrate (HQK-1001), an orally-bioavailable promoter-targeted fetal globin gene-inducing agent, was evaluated in an open-label, randomized dose-escalation study in 52 subjects with hemoglobin SS or S/Î²(0) thalassemia. HQK-1001 was administered daily for 26 weeks at 30 mg/kg (n = 15), 40 mg/kg (n = 18) and 50 mg/kg (n = 19), either alone (n = 21) or with hydroxyurea (n = 31). The most common drug-related adverse events were usually mild or moderate and reversible. Gastritis was graded as severe in three subjects at 40 mg/kg and was considered the dose-limiting toxicity. Subsequently all subjects were switched to the maximum tolerated dose of 30 mg/kg. Due to early discontinuations for blood transfusions, adverse events or non-compliance, only 25 subjects (48%) completed the study. Drug plasma concentrations were sustained above targeted levels at 30 mg/kg. Increases in fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) were observed in 42 subjects (80%), and 12 (23%) had increases â¥4%. The mean increase in Hb F was 2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.8-3.2%] in 21 subjects receiving HQK-1001 alone and 2.7% (95% CI, 1.7-3.8%) in 31 subjects receiving HQK-1001 plus hydroxyurea. Total hemoglobin increased by a mean of 0.65 g/dL (95% CI, 0.5-1.0 g/dL), and 13 subjects (25%) had increases â¥1 g/dL. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the therapeutic potential of HQK-1001 in sickle cell disease. .",

"Cardiovascular imaging is an important part of procedural planning and safety for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the costs of imaging surrounding catheter ablation of AF have not been described. Medicare fee-for-service data were used to evaluate Medicare expenditures before, during, and after catheter ablation for AF from July 2007 to December 2009. Among 11,525 patients who underwent catheter ablation for AF, the mean overall expenditure on the day of the procedure was $14,455 (SD $7,441). The mean imaging expenditure in the periprocedural period, which included the 30 days before the catheter ablation and the day of the ablation itself, was $884 (SD $455). Periprocedural imaging expenditures varied by the imaging strategy used, ranging from a mean of $557 (SD $269) for patients with electroanatomic mapping only to $1,234 (SD $461) for patients with electroanatomic mapping, transesophageal echocardiogram, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Mean patient-level imaging expenditures varied by provider (mean $872, SD $249). Periprocedural imaging expenditures also varied by patient risk, with mean expenditures of $862 (SD $444) for patients with a CHADS2 score of â¥2 compared with $907 (SD $466) for CHADS2 score<2 (p<0.001). In conclusion, periprocedural imaging accounts for approximately 6% of mean Medicare expenditures for catheter ablation of AF. The expenditures for periprocedural imaging vary both at the patient and at the provider level and they are inversely related to stroke risk by CHADS2 score.",
"The regimen was a single intramuscular injection with two non-replicating human serotype 5 adenovectors encoding CSP and AMA1, respectively.

"Warfarin is a complex but highly effective treatment for decreasing thromboembolic risk in atrial fibrillation (AF). We examined contemporary warfarin treatment rates in AF before the expected introduction of newer anticoagulants and extent of practice-level variation in warfarin use. Within the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence program from July 2008 through December 2009, we identified 9,113 outpatients with AF from 20 sites who were at moderate to high risk for stroke (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke score >1) and would be optimally treated with warfarin. Using hierarchical models, the extent of site-level variation was quantified with the median rate ratio, which can be interpreted as the likelihood that 2 random practices would differ in treating "identical" patients with warfarin. Overall rate of warfarin treatment was only 55.1% (5,018 of 9,913). Untreated patients and treated patients had mean congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke scores of 2.5 (p = 0.38) and similar rates of heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke, suggesting an almost "random" pattern of treatment. At the practice level, however, there was substantial variation in treatment ranging from 25% to 80% (interquartile range for practices 50 to 65), with a median rate ratio of 1.31 (1.22 to 1.55, p <0.001). In conclusion, within the Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence registry, we found that warfarin treatment in AF was suboptimal, with large variations in treatment observed across practices. Our findings suggest important opportunities for practice-level improvement in stroke prevention for outpatients with AF and define a benchmark treatment rate before the introduction of newer anticoagulant agents.",

"Intra-operative hypertensive episodes are a frequent problem in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The haemodynamic effects of the alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs phentolamine and urapidil, two alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs with a different alpha-receptor subtype specificity, when used to control intra-operative hypertension were evaluated. Ten patients received phentolamine (about 25 micrograms kg-1 min-1) and ten patients received urapidil (about 100 micrograms kg-1 min-1) to return arterial blood pressure to control levels. Both drugs decreased arterial pressure to baseline values within 2-3 minutes by reducing the elevated systemic vascular resistance. Treatment with phentolamine was accompanied by a marked increase in heart rate with a concomitant increase in cardiac index and the rate-pressure product. Urapidil caused no change in heart rate, but the cardiac index increased. Urapidil lowered the rate-pressure product significantly. Both drugs reduced mean pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. The different selectivity of phentolamine and urapidil to alpha 1-and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors induces the diverse haemodynamic effects. We conclude that the use of urapidil is the superior regimen when an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent is favoured as a vasodilator.",

"The Diabetes mellitus Insulin-Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI) 2 Quality of Life (QoL) sub-study included 465 patients with type 2 diabetes and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) followed for 2 years. Self-rated health was reported by the rating scale (RS), graded 0 = death to 100 = perfect health. Prospective associations between RS and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CV) death and cardiovascular events (CVEs = CV death, non-fatal AMI, stroke) were assessed. Median age was 68 years (range 59-74), 68% male. Patients experiencing CVE (n = 132) or death (n = 71) had lower RS compared with patients free from events: 60 (50-79) versus 70 (55-81) (p < 0.001) and 60 (50-75) versus 70 (51-80) (p = 0.008). The RS score predicted CVE [hazard ratio (HR); 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.87; 0.80-0.95] and all-cause mortality (0.86; 0.76-0.97), and corresponding HRs after adjustment were 0.90; 0.83-0.99 and 0.90; 0.79-1.02, respectively. A low self-rated health is of prognostic importance in patients with type 2 diabetes and AMI and may serve as an easily obtainable indicator of high risk for CVEs supplementing traditional risk factors.",

"Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) threatens global TB control. The lengthy treatment includes one of the injectable drugs kanamycin, amikacin, and capreomycin, usually for the first 6 months. These drugs have potentially serious toxicities, and when given as intramuscular injections, dosing can be painful. Advances in particulate drug delivery have led to the formulation of capreomycin as the first antituberculosis drug available as a microparticle dry powder for inhalation and clinical study. Delivery by aerosol may result in successful treatment with lower doses. Here we report a phase I, single-dose, dose-escalating study aimed at demonstrating safety and tolerability in healthy subjects and measuring pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Twenty healthy adults (n = 5 per group) were recruited to self-administer a single dose of inhaled dry powder capreomycin (25-mg, 75-mg, 150-mg, or 300-mg nominal dose) using a simple, handheld delivery device. Inhalations were well tolerated by all subjects. The most common adverse event was mild to moderate transient cough, in five subjects. There were no changes in lung function, audiometry, or laboratory parameters. Capreomycin was rapidly absorbed after inhalation. Systemic concentrations were detected in each dose group within 20 min. Peak and mean plasma concentrations of capreomycin were dose proportional. Serum concentrations exceeded 2 Î¼g/ml (MIC for Mycobacterium tuberculosis) following the highest dose; the half-life (t1/2) was 4.8 Â± 1.0 h. A novel inhaled microparticle dry powder formulation of capreomycin was well tolerated. A single 300-mg dose rapidly achieved serum drug concentrations above the MIC for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, suggesting the potential of inhaled therapy as part of an MDR-TB treatment regimen.",

"Treatment guidelines for atrial fibrillation (AF) used in Western countries describe female gender as a risk factor for thromboembolic events in patients with nonvalvular AF (NVAF). The present study aimed to determine the impact of gender on prognosis of Japanese patients with NVAF. A subanalysis of 7,406 patients with NVAF (mean age 70 years) who were followed-up prospectively for 2 years was performed using data from the J-RHYTHM registry. The primary end points were thromboembolic events, major hemorrhaging, total mortality, and cardiovascular mortality. Compared with male subjects (n = 5,241), female subjects (n = 2,165) were older and displayed greater prevalences of paroxysmal AF, heart failure, and hypertension but less prevalences of diabetes, previous cerebral infarction, and coronary artery disease. Male and female patients had mean CHADS2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age of 75 years or more, Diabetes mellitus and prior Stroke or transient ischemic attack) scores of 1.6 and 1.8, respectively (p <0.001). Warfarin was given to 87% of male patients and 86% of female patients (p = 0.760), and the 2 genders displayed similar mean international normalized ratio of prothrombin time values at baseline (1.91 vs 1.90, respectively, p = 0.756). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that male gender was an independent risk factor for major hemorrhaging (odds ratio 1.59, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.40, p = 0.027) and all-cause mortality (odds ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.55, p <0.002) but not for thromboembolic events (odds ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 0.83 to 1.86, p = 0.297) or cardiovascular mortality (odds ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.66, p = 0.893). In conclusion, female gender is not a risk factor for thromboembolic events among Japanese patients with NVAF who were treated mostly with warfarin. However, male gender is a risk factor for major hemorrhaging and all-cause mortality.",

"Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been widely used in the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax. The unexpectedly high increase of the recurrence rate is the most important problem. We examined the interaction between recurrence, clinical features and patient's backgrounds.

"The etiology of pericardial effusions remains unresolved in many cases because not the full spectrum of diagnostic methods including cytology, histology, immunohistology and PCR on cardiotropic agents, which are currently available, used in many institutions. After comprehensive clinical workup and use of imaging methods, such as echocardiography and cardiac MRI, pericardiocentesis and epicardial and pericardial biopsy were carried out under pericardioscopical control of the biopsy site. Biopsies and fluid were evaluated by cytological, histological, immunological and molecular (PCR) methods in 259 patients of our tertiary referral center following an identical clinical pathway, diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm in all cases. A standard clinical pathway and the same diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms were used in all cases. When all methods are applied to patients with pericardial effusions, "idiopathic" pericardial effusion is no longer a relevant diagnosis. Autoreactive and lymphocytic pericardial effusions are the leading diagnosis in 35Â % of patients in the prospective Marburg registry, followed by malignant effusions in 28Â % of cases. Viral genome was assessed in fluid and epi- as well as pericardial biopsies in 12Â %, followed by post-traumatic/iatrogenic effusions in 15Â % and purulent/bacterial effusions in only 2Â %. Pericardioscopy permits the macroscopic inspection of the pulsating heart and its disease-associated macroscopic alterations. It also permits safe and targeted biopsy for further investigations of the tissue. Therapy, tailored to the individual etiology, can be selected such as intrapericardial instillation in autoreactive effusions with triamcinolone and with cisplatin or thiotepa in neoplastic effusions. With this approach the recurrence of pericardial effusion can be avoided effectively. A comprehensive approach to the diagnosis of pericardial effusions in conjunction with pericardioscopy for targeted tissue sampling is the prerequisite for an etiologically based intrapericardial and systemic treatment, which improves outcome and prognosis.",

"Artemisinin combination therapies eliminate immature Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes but not mature gametocytes, which may persist for up to 1 month posttreatment. A single dose of primaquine, which is inexpensive and effective against mature gametocytes, could be added to further reduce the potential for posttreatment parasite transmission. Currently, we have few data regarding the effectiveness or safety of doing so. We collected data from 21 therapeutic efficacy trials of the National Antimalarial Drug Resistance Monitoring System of India conducted during 2009 to 2010, wherein 9 sites used single-dose primaquine (0.75 mg/kg of body weight) administered on day 2 along with artesunate plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) while 12 did not. We estimated the effect of primaquine on posttreatment gametocyte clearance and the total number of gametocyte-weeks as determined by microscopy. We compared the median area under the curve for gametocyte density and reported adverse events. One thousand three hundred thirty-five patients completed the antimalarial drug treatment. Adjusting for region, primaquine increased the rate of gametocyte clearance (hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 3.3), prevented 45% (95% CI, 19 to 62) of posttreatment gametocyte-weeks, and decreased the area under the gametocyte density curve over the 28-day follow-up compared to AS+SP alone (P value = 0.01). The results were robust to other adjustment sets, and the estimated effect of primaquine increased during sensitivity analysis on the measurement of exposure time. No serious adverse events were detected. In conclusion, the addition of primaquine to AS+SP was effective in reducing the posttreatment presence of P. falciparum gametocytes. Primaquine was well tolerated and could be administered along with an artemisinin combination therapy as the first-line therapy.",

"Although evidence is accumulating that hydroxycarbamide decreases mortality among adults with sickle cell disease (SCD), there are no published data regarding the effect of hydroxycarbamide on mortality among children. The Paediatric Hydroxycarbamide Program was established to treat children with SCD aged 3-18Â years if they met disease severity criteria. Mortality data and clinical/laboratorial effects of hydroxycarbamide were retrospectively collected for the first 9Â years of the Program. Mortality among those who received hydroxycarbamide was compared to that of untreated children. Among 1760 subjects, 267 received hydroxycarbamide at a median dose of 20Â·8Â mg/kg/d (range 10-32) for a median of 2Â years (range 0Â·1-6Â·5). Survival among hydroxycarbamide-treated children was significantly greater than that among untreated ones (99Â·5% vs. 94Â·5%, PÂ =Â 0Â·01), due primarily to fewer deaths from acute chest syndrome and infection. Hydroxycarbamide therapy was significantly associated with increases in haemoglobin concentration, fetal haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and reduction in platelet counts, reticulocytes and neutrophils. Toxicity was minimal and predominantly mild reversible neutropenia. Significantly fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits, and shorter admissions were observed among hydroxycarbamide-treated subjects, when compared to the 12-month period prior to treatment initiation. Hydroxycarbamide therapy reduces disease severity and is probably associated with decreased mortality among children with SCD.",
"Many efficacy endpoints have been used in clinical trials of acute migraine pharmacotherapy. Headache response or headache relief (i.e., moderate/severe pain reduced to mild/no pain) at a single, specified time-point, traditionally the primary endpoint, and headache recurrence (i.e., return of pain after initial postdose relief) are inadequate. Headache relief does not provide information about pain-free response and counts a partial response as a treatment success. Headache recurrence can reflect sustained efficacy but is confounded by initial response to treatment, because ineffective drugs have low recurrence rates. The International Headache Society (IHS) guidelines state that 2 hour pain-free response and sustained pain-free response (i.e., freedom from pain with no recurrence or use of rescue or study medication 2-24 hours postdose) provide the most clinically relevant information about the efficacy of migraine pharmacotherapy. The pain-free criterion counts partial responses as failures and thus is a more rigorous test of therapeutic benefit than headache relief, and the two endpoints together incorporate the main treatment attributes that determine patient satisfaction. As an example, consider needle-free subcutaneous sumatriptan and oral triptan tablets. An open-label study of needle-free subcutaneous sumatriptan by Cady and colleagues found that 2 hour pain-free response and sustained pain-free response were 64% and 42% respectively. For oral triptan tablets, the 2001 metaanalysis by Ferrari and colleagues reported 2 hour pain-free response rates ranging from 23% to 38% and sustained pain-free response rates ranging from 11% to 26%. The measures of pain-free response 2 hours postdose and sustained pain-free response can differentiate among treatments and be used to guide therapeutic choices.",

"We explored the utility of T-wave alternans (TWA) in predicting mortality in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS). Maximum TWA was calculated using Modified Moving Average method from continuous electrocardiographic recordings in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <40% and ventricular tachycardia (VT) â¥4 beats during index hospitalization or sudden cardiac death during theÂ follow-up year and age- and sex-matched controls in the Metabolic Efficiency withÂ Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (MERLIN-TIMI) 36 trial. All patients received standard therapy for NSTEACS plus ranolazine (nÂ = 109) or placebo (nÂ = 101). Median follow-up was 1Â year. Baseline clinical characteristics did not differ between patients with elevated TWA (â¥47Â Î¼V) compared with lower levels. Patients with TWA â¥47Â Î¼V at admission had increased risk of total mortality (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] 2.35, pÂ = 0.04) during follow-up and VT â¥4 beats (ORadj 2.70, pÂ = 0.01) during hospitalization with a trend toward increased cardiovascular death risk (ORadj 2.18, pÂ = 0.07) during follow-up. In patients receiving placebo, TWA â¥47Â Î¼V on day 6 was associated with increased risk of total mortality (OR 4.12, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 13.64, pÂ = 0.02) and cardiovascular death (OR 4.73, pÂ = 0.01) during follow-up. No deaths occurred among patients with TWA â¥47Â Î¼V assigned to ranolazine. In conclusion, in patients with NSTEACS and left ventricular ejection fraction <40%, TWA â¥47Â Î¼V early after admission is associated with increased risk of mortality at 1Â year and with nonsustained VT during hospitalization. TWA may be useful in risk estimation in patients with NSTEACS. The possibility that TWA may serve as a therapeutic target deserves further exploration.",

"The current guidelines most strongly support cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for patients with heart failure with a QRS width of â¥150 ms and left bundle branch block (LBBB). Our objective was to assess the potential benefit of echocardiographically guided left ventricular (LV) lead positioning for patients with a QRS width <150 ms or non-LBBB as a substudy of the Speckle Tracking Assisted Resynchronization Therapy for Electrode Region (STARTER) prospective, randomized controlled trial. The STARTER trial randomized 187 patients with heart failure, a QRS of â¥120 ms, and ejection fraction of â¤35% to LV lead guided to the site of latest mechanical activation by speckle tracking radial strain versus routine implantation. The predefined primary end point was heart failure hospitalization or death within 2 years. This substudy included 151 CRT patients with matching echocardiographic and LV lead position data and complete follow-up data. Patients with a QRS width of 120 to 149 ms or non-LBBB and LV lead concordant or adjacent to the site of latest mechanical activation had favorable outcomes after CRT similar to those with LBBB or a QRS width of â¥150 ms. In contrast, patients with a QRS of 120 to 149 ms or non-LBBB and remote LV leads had unfavorable outcomes (hazard ratio 5.45, 95% confidence interval 2.36 to 12.6, p <0.001, and hazard ratio 4.92, 95% confidence interval 2.12 to 11.39, p <0.001, respectively, with significant interaction after adjusting for baseline variables, p = 0.038 and p = 0.008).

"The aim of this study was to assess whether a 2 mm mini-videothoracoscope could be used as a conventional videothoracoscope in the management of pneumothorax. Thirty patients of ages from 15 to 35 years with recurrent or persistent pneumothorax were involved in this study. The subjects consisted of 27 males and three females. The indications for videothoracoscopic surgery were ipsilateral recurrent pneumothorax in 12 (40%), persistent air leakage in 15 (50%), visible bullae in 2 (6%), and 1 bilateral pneumothorax (3%). The mean operation time was 42.9+/-12.9 min. The average number of uses for Endo-GIA was 1.9+/-1.3 times and chest tube indwelling time was 3.8+/-2.7 days. The average amount of keptoprofen (100 mg/2 mL/ampule) used on the first postoperative day was 1.2+/-1.1 ampules. No parenteral opioids were given to the patients for pain control after the procedures. After a follow up of 8 to 20 months, there was only one recurrence among the patients. In conclusion, a 2 mm videothoracoscope, in selective cases, can be successfully used as conventional videothoracoscope to manage persistent or recurrent pneumothorax with cosmetically excellent results.",

Confirmation of such subtle findings should be sought through repeat testing and correlation with other clinical results.",
"According to the promising results of the Phase I and Phase IIA clinical trials with the herbal medicinal product PR 259 CT1 consisting of an 80 % ethanolic extract of the stem bark of Nauclea pobeguinii containing 5.6 % strictosamide, a Phase IIB study was conducted as a single blind prospective trial in 65 patients with proven Plasmodium falciparum malaria to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this herbal drug. The study was carried out simultaneously using an artesunate-amodiaquine combination (CoarsucamÂ®) as a positive control. This combination is the standard first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria recommended by the National Programme of Malaria Control in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). With regard to PR 259 CT1, patients were treated with a drug regimen of two 500-mg capsules three times daily for three days in the inpatient clinic, followed by out-patient treatment of one 500-mg capsule three times daily during the next four days; the positive control group received two tablets containing 100 mg artesunate and 270 mg amodiaquine (fixed-dose) once daily during three consecutive days. Antimalarial responses were evaluated according to the WHO 2003 guideline for a 14-day test. The results from the physical and laboratory examinations did not show any significant changes in values of vital signs, ECG, biochemical, and haematological parameters. The study showed a significant decreased parasitaemia in patients treated with PR 29 CT1 and artesunate-amodiaquine with adequate clinical parasitological responses (APCR) at day 14 of 87.9 and 96.9 %, respectively. The former product was better tolerated than the latter since more side effects were observed for the artesunate-amodiaquine combination. These results indicated that PR 259 CT1 can be considered as a promising candidate for the development of a herbal medicine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria.",
"We compared complications of pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) insertion and maintenance at internal jugular (IJ) vs. subclavian (SC) sites. Patients were randomized into groups using an IJ or SC route, and insertions were timed. An air-permeable dressing and anticontamination shield were used. Catheters were removed 72 h after insertion. If PAC monitoring was still needed, a new catheter was either inserted over a guidewire at the initial insertion site or inserted at a new site. On removal, the catheter tip, introducer-sheath tip, and catheter within the shield were submitted for semiquantitative culture. Sixty-six catheters were initially inserted, and 26 were changed. No determinative differences in the time for venous cannulation were found, but the IJ route was slightly faster. In 3% of the catheterizations, serious complications arose. The infection rate was 2% for initial catheters, 8% for second catheters placed over a guidewire, and 15% for second catheters placed at a new site. These differences were not consequential. No local infection or catheter-related sepsis occurred. Thus, using a standard, sterile-insertion technique and a catheter-maintenance protocol yielded a low risk of insertion and infectious complications at either the IJ or SC site. Our data indicated that PACs can be changed safely over a guidewire at 72 h, avoiding further insertion risks without increasing infectious complications.",

Reosorbilact was used intravenously indrops 200-400 ml in day - 20 days. The primary endpoint of the study was the improvement of quality of life assessed with the SF-36 scale after 1 month of treatment. Patients with brain ischemia underwent neuropsychological tests and ultrasound duplex scanning of the carotid and vertebral arteries. In the group of patients with diabetic neuropathy, we evaluated the intensity of pain syndrome with the NRS, blood glucose level and electroneuromyography parameters of low extremities nerves. Some characteristics of acid-base balance were studied in patients of both groups. The results obtained in the study indicate the significant clinical effect of reosorbilact in patients with brain ischemia and diabetic neuropathy.",

"Two different self-help training programs (multimodal cognitive-behavioral training (CBT) and applied relaxation (AR)) presented via the Internet were compared with an educational intervention (EDU) in an RCT. Sixty-five children and adolescents (mean age: 12.7 years) with recurrent headache (at least 2 attacks per month) were each assigned to one of the three treatment conditions. The main outcome variables related to changes in headache frequency, intensity and duration as well as the responder rate (50% reduction of headache frequency) and NNTs. Secondary outcome variables were pain catastrophizing and general well-being (depression, psychopathological symptoms and health-related quality of life). All groups showed significant reduction in headache frequency, duration and pain catastrophizing, but not in headache intensity, depression, psychopathological symptoms or health-related quality of life at post-assessment. NNTs were 2.0 for the comparison CBT and EDU; 5.2 for the comparison of AR and EDU at post-treatment. The highest responder rates at post were from CBT (63%), significantly different compared to AR (32%) and EDU (19%), whereas at follow-up no significant differences were found (CBT: 63%, AR: 56%, EDU: 55%) reflecting in the NNTs. The effects remain stable in headache frequency, pain catastrophizing and psychopathological symptoms across all groups at follow-up assessment. CBT showed the highest within-effect size in headache frequency, duration and pain catastrophizing. The results support the use of Internet programs for pediatric recurrent headache, especially given their accessibility and suitability for children and adolescents. Further studies are needed to improve their quality and efficacy.",

"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) cause substantial mortality and morbidity in both children and adults. Identification of poor prognostic factors at patient's admission could prepare physicians for more aggressive monitoring of patients with meningitis. The objective of this study was to determine the predictive value of neurological features to differentiate ABM and TBM. A retrospective study was conducted between patients affected with ABM or TBM admitted to three teaching hospitals during the last 14 years in Zahedan the central city of Sistan and Balouchestan province (Iran). The neurological features include seizure, level of consciousness, stroke, focal neurologic deficit and cranial nerve palsy at the time of admission. Mean age for patients with TBM and ABM were 41 Â± 22.4 and 24 Â± 18.5 years respectively. In univariate analysis, all measured variables revealed significant difference between ABM and TBM patients except for seizure episodes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed positive predictive effect of cranial nerve palsy (AOR=1.980, CI 95%: 1.161-3.376) on the diagnosis of TBM. In our study cranial nerve palsies was the most important neurological predictor factor to differentiate TBM from ABM.",

"Migraine is often a chronic and disabling disorder. The objective of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of gabapentin in the prophylaxis of migraine in patients refractory to other prophylactic treatments. The study included 67 migraine patients, 55 women and 12 men; 52 patients completed this prospective, open-label study. Patients were given 900-1800 mg of gabapentin in 3 doses; the mean duration of treatment was 7.2 months. Reduction in the number of days with headache, pain intensity and number of acute medications was assessed through patient diary. The mean number of migraine days/4 weeks was reduced from 15.8 to 8.6, yielding a reduction of 7.2 migraine days/4 weeks (P=0.001). Pain intensity was reduced by 25% in 14 (26.9%), by 50% in 29 (55.7%) and by 75% in three (5.7%) patients, whereas no improvement was reported by six (11.5%) patients at the end of follow up. A significant reduction was recorded in acute medication use (P=0.001). Adverse events were reported by 32/67 (47.8%) patients, in 15 (22.4%) of them causing discontinuation of the drug. The most frequently reported adverse events were drowsiness, dizziness and slowness. Prophylactic treatment with gabapentin was found to be associated with a significant reduction in the number of days with headache, use of acute medications and pain intensity.",

"Recently, a new latanoprost ophthalmic solution containing cyclodextrins was developed. The purpose of the present work was to compare the stability, clinical efficacy, and adverse effect profile of this formulation with the innovator product. The innovator formulation was stable at 4 degrees C but exhibited degradation at higher temperatures, whereas the cyclodextrin-containing formulation was stable at temperatures up to 40 degrees C. Formulations were assayed in a randomized double-blind clinical study in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension. Both latanoprost ophthalmic solutions produced comparable reduction of intraocular pressure. Conjunctival hyperemia was observed in 11.9% and 11.3% of the patients treated with the innovator and the cyclodextrin-containing formulations, respectively. There were no significant differences between the 2 ophthalmic solutions in efficacy or in the measured adverse effect. It is concluded that these 2 latanoprost ophthalmic solutions yield comparable efficacy and adverse effect outcomes. The cyclodextrin-containing formulation, however, has an improved stability.",

"Immunocompromised patients such as those with end-stage kidney failure under-going hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). For this reason, routine TB screening of HD patients with tuberculin test has been recommended. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that patients with chronic renal failure should undergo annual skin testing for TB with tuberculin [purified protein derivative (PPD)], with an induration of â¥10 mm at 48 h depicting a positive reaction. The aim of this study was to compare the results of two different doses of PPD in dialysis patients. This descriptive and comparative multicenter study was performed on 255 patients on chronic dialysis in Tabriz, Iran. These patients did not have the PPD test done within the preceding one year. Patients were divided into two groups randomly and conventional or double-dose tuberculin test was performed using the Mantoux technique with 5 IU (group 1) and 10 IU (group 2) of PPD. Results were interpreted 48-72 h after injection. Patients were divided into those with less than 10 mm and those with â¥10 mm duration. Mean age was 44.6 Â± 15 years (M/F = 1.5/1). The mean duration on dialysis was 39 Â± 7 months. There was no significant difference regarding the age, gender, dura-tion on dialysis, causes of chronic kidney disease, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and serum albumin between the two groups. The mean induration was 4.6 mm and 7.7 mm in groups 1 and 2, respectively. There was induration â¥10 mm in 19.6% and 25.5% of group 1 and 2, respectively, which showed a significant difference (P <0.05). In conclusion, because of the high frequency of TB in dialysis patients, an annual tuberculin test may be recommended. Our study showed that the double-dose tuberculin test may be a better substitute to the conventional test in dialysis patients.",

"PA-824 is a novel nitroimidazo-oxazine under evaluation as an antituberculosis agent. A dose-ranging randomized study was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and early bactericidal activity of PA-824 in drug-sensitive, sputum smear-positive adult pulmonary-tuberculosis patients to find the lowest dose giving optimal bactericidal activity (EBA). Fifteen patients per cohort received oral PA-824 in doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, or 200 mg per kg body weight per day for 14 days. Eight subjects received once-daily standard antituberculosis treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (HRZE) as a positive control. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean rate of decline in log CFU of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum incubated on agar plates from serial overnight sputum collections, expressed as log(10) CFU/day/ml sputum (Â± standard deviation). The mean 14-day EBA of HRZE was consistent with previous studies (0.177 Â± 0.042), and that of PA-824 at 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg was 0.063 Â± 0.058, 0.091 Â± 0.073, 0.078 Â± 0.074, and 0.112 Â± 0.070, respectively. Although the study was not powered for testing the difference between arms, there was a trend toward significance, indicating a lower EBA at the 50-mg dose. Serum PA-824 levels were approximately dose proportional with respect to the area under the time-concentration curve. All doses were safe and well tolerated with no dose-limiting adverse events or clinically significant QTc changes. A dose of 100 mg to 200 mg PA-824 daily appears to be safe and efficacious and will be further evaluated as a component of novel antituberculosis regimens for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis.",
"Multicenter trials in Southeast Asia have shown better survival rates among patients with severe malaria, particularly those with high parasitemia levels, treated with intravenous (IV) artesunate than among those treated with quinine. In Europe, quinine is still the primary treatment for severe malaria. We conducted a retrospective analysis for 25 travelers with severe malaria who returned from malaria-endemic regions and were treated at 7 centers in Europe. All patients survived. Treatment with IV artesunate rapidly reduced parasitemia levels. In 6 patients at 5 treatment centers, a self-limiting episode of unexplained hemolysis occurred after reduction of parasitemia levels. Five patients required a blood transfusion. Patients with posttreatment hemolysis had received higher doses of IV artesunate than patients without hemolysis. IV artesunate was an effective alternative to quinine for treatment of malaria patients in Europe. Patients should be monitored for signs of hemolysis, especially after parasitologic cure.",

"Experimental studies have shown that infusion of vasoactive neurotransmitters may trigger headache or migraine-like attacks in man. Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide-38 (PACAP38) is a strong vasodilator found in trigeminal sensory and parasympathetic perivascular nerve fibers. We therefore hypothesized that infusion of PACAP38 would cause headache in healthy subjects and migraine-like attacks in migraine patients. Twelve healthy subjects and 12 migraine patients were examined in two separate studies. All subjects were allocated to receive 10 pmol/kg/min PACAP38 and placebo in a randomized, double-blind crossover study design. Headache was scored on a verbal rating scale (VRS) during hospital (0-2 h) and post-hospital (2-12 h) phases. Mean blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V(MCA)) by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and diameter of the superficial temporal artery (STA) by high resolution ultrasonography were recorded during hospital phase in migraineurs. PACAP38 infusion caused headache in all healthy subjects and 11 out of 12 migraine patients. Seven migraine patients experienced migraine-like attacks after PACAP38 and none after placebo (P = 0.016). Most of attacks (6 out of 7) occurred during the post-hospital phase [mean time 6 h (range 2-11)]. Two healthy subjects reported migraine-like attacks after PACAP38 during the hospital phase and none during the post-hospital phase. In the hospital phase, the area under the curve (AUC) for headache score was larger during PACAP38 infusion compared to placebo in healthy subjects (P = 0.005) and tended to be larger in migraineurs (P = 0.066). In the post-hospital phase, the AUC for headache was larger after PACAP38 infusion compared to placebo in both healthy subjects (P = 0.005) and migraine patients (P = 0.013). In migraine patients, PACAP38 caused a peak decrease of 16.1% in V(MCA) and a 37.5% increase in STA diameter at 20 min after start of infusion. In conclusion, PACAP38 infusion caused headache and vasodilatation in both healthy subjects and migraine patients. In migraine sufferers, PACAP38 caused delayed migraine-like attacks. The findings stimulate further investigation of the neuronal and vascular mechanisms of PACAP38.",
"Efficacy trials of antibody-inducing protein-in-adjuvant vaccines targeting the blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasite have so far shown disappointing results. The induction of cell-mediated responses in conjunction with antibody responses is thought to be one alternative strategy that could achieve protective efficacy in humans. Here, we prepared chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) replication-deficient vectors encoding the well-studied P. falciparum blood-stage malaria antigen merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1). A phase Ia clinical trial was conducted in healthy adults of a ChAd63-MVA MSP1 heterologous prime-boost immunization regime. The vaccine was safe and generally well tolerated. Fewer systemic adverse events (AEs) were observed following ChAd63 MSP1 than MVA MSP1 administration. Exceptionally strong T-cell responses were induced, and these displayed a mixed of CD4(+) and CD8(+) phenotype. Substantial MSP1-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses were also induced, which were capable of recognizing native parasite antigen, but these did not reach titers sufficient to neutralize P. falciparum parasites in vitro. This viral vectored vaccine regime is thus a leading approach for the induction of strong cellular and humoral immunogenicity against difficult disease targets in humans. Further studies are required to assess whether this strategy can achieve protective efficacy against blood-stage malaria infection.",

In a 12-week, multicenter, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, dose-finding study, we evaluated senicapoc's safety and its effect on hemoglobin level and markers of RBC hemolysis in sickle cell anemia patients. The patients were randomized into 3 treatment arms: placebo; low-dose (6 mg/day) senicapoc; and high-dose (10 mg/day) senicapoc. For the primary efficacy end point (change in hemoglobin level from baseline), the mean response to high-dose senicapoc treatment exceeded placebo (6.8 g/L [0.68 g/dL] vs 0.1 g/L [0.01 g/dL], P < .001). Treatment with high-dose senicapoc also produced significant decreases in such secondary end points as percentage of dense RBCs (-2.41 vs -0.08, P < .001); reticulocytes (-4.12 vs -0.46, P < .001); lactate dehydrogenase (-121 U/L vs -15 U/L, P = .002); and indirect bilirubin (-1.18 mg/dL vs 0.12 mg/dL, P < .001). Finally, senicapoc was safe and well tolerated. The increased hemoglobin concentration and concomitant decrease in the total number of reticulocytes and various markers of RBC destruction following senicapoc administration suggests a possible increase in the survival of sickle RBCs. This study is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00040677.",
"To improve understanding of secondary treatment failure in migraine patients, we evaluated 'headache return' as a novel endpoint to assess returning headaches according to their severity, expanding on current standard assessments of overall recurrence or relapse rates, in a six-month observational study of triptan-treated migraineurs. A total of 359 patients (91% female; mean age, 42.5 years) recorded data for 2168 headaches in electronic diaries. Two-thirds of headaches responded to triptan treatment (improved-to-mild or no pain two hours post-dose); 34% of headaches had a pain-free response. By 48 hours post-dose, 19% of all responding headaches returned; 24% of headaches achieving a pain-free response returned, predominantly to mild pain. More severe baseline headache, short duration since diagnosis of migraine, and female gender were associated with increased likelihood of headache return. Treatment satisfaction declined with increasing severity of headache return, demonstrating the value of assessing headache return by severity to fully evaluate its impact.",
"The prevalence and correlates of cardiovascular risk factors in older adults with intellectual disability was examined. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 50- to 90-year-old clients (N = 470) of three Dutch intellectual disability care providing organizations and found that healthy behavior was low, with 98.9% of the participants having an unhealthy diet and 68.3%, a lack of exercise. Smoking (13.6%) and alcohol abuse (0.3%) were relatively minor problems. Abdominal overweight (70.4%), diabetes (8.7%), hypertension (36.8%), and hypercholesterolemia (31.8%) were highly prevalent. These profiles have important implications in determining the risk of cardiovascular disease in people with intellectual disability. Campaigns to promote health should be focused on education and the introduction of preventive screening programs.",
"Risk factor profiles and their modification were not similar among patients in Japan with MI, stroke, and NVAF, although they share a high risk of thrombotic events.",
"Our results suggest that insulin treatment is an effective and safe therapeutic option in Japanese patients with T2DM, and earlier insulin initiation might be associated with better glycemic control.",
"Following the World Health Organization's endorsement of the XpertÂ® MTB/RIF assay, which rapidly and simultaneously diagnoses tuberculosis (TB) and detects resistance to rifampin (RMP), the question arises to what extent RMP resistance is an adequate marker for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). A retrospective analysis of data from >81 countries and subnational settings demonstrated that >40% of RMP-resistant isolates from new TB cases did not display resistance to isoniazid (INH) in settings with relatively low MDR-TB prevalence (one third of all countries and subnational settings). Results indicated the need for INH susceptibility testing in addition to RMP susceptibility testing.",
