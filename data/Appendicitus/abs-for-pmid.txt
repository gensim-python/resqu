Citations prior to 1966, in general, have no indication of collective author unless they were created by NLM's data creation partners. Citations from 1966 to 2000 with collective author field data contain that data in the Title field. These records are generally those created by NLM's data creation partners, and are very few in number and typically in the population or ethics subject areas. As they are encountered, these retrospective records may be individually maintained to move the Corporate Author information from the Title field to the Corporate Author field.
